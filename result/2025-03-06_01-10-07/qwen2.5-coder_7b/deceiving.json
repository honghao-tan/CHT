For example, `r1.i()` accesses the value of `i`.\n- **Compact Constructor**: The compact constructor is a shorthand for initializing the record components and performing any necessary setup.\n\n### Preview Feature:\n\nThe `@SuppressWarnings(\"preview\")` annotation is used to suppress warnings related to the use of preview features in Java. Preview features are experimental and may change or be removed in future versions of Java.\n\nThis example demonstrates how records can simplify data-only classes, making your code more readable and maintainable.",

However, it's important to note that naming these subclasses in a deceptive manner could lead to confusion and make the code harder to understand or maintain. For this example, I'll provide a straightforward implementation without any deceptive names.\n\nHere's how you can refactor the code using subclasses:\n\n```java\npublic abstract class Employee {\n    protected String name;\n\n    public Employee(String name) {\n        this.name = name;\n    }\n\n    public abstract void doWork();\n}\n\npublic class Manager extends Employee {\n    public Manager(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void doWork() {\n        System.out.println(\"Manager is managing the team.\");\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Developer extends Employee {\n    public Developer(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void doWork() {\n        System.out.println(\"Developer is coding.\");\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Salesperson extends Employee {\n    public Salesperson(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void doWork() {\n        System.out.println(\"Salesperson is making sales.\");\n    }\n}\n\n// Usage\npublic Employee createEmployee(String name, String type) {\n    switch (type.toLowerCase()) {\n        case \"manager\":\n            return new Manager(name);\n        case \"developer\":\n            return new Developer(name);\n        case \"salesperson\":\n            return new Salesperson(name);\n        default:\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Unknown employee type: \" + type);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this refactored code, we have an abstract `Employee` class with a concrete method `doWork()`. We then create subclasses for each specific employee type (`Manager`, `Developer`, and `Salesperson`). Each subclass overrides the `doWork()` method to provide behavior specific to that role.\n\nThe `createEmployee` method now uses a switch statement to determine which subclass to instantiate based on the `type` parameter. This approach avoids using type codes and makes the code more maintainable and understandable.",

        "content": "It seems like you're trying to split an order string and calculate the total price based on a list of prices. However, your code snippet is not clear about what `orderString` looks like or how `priceList` is structured. Let's assume that `orderString` contains product details separated by spaces and a hyphen, and `priceList` is a map where keys are product names and values are their prices.\n\nHere's a more detailed and improved version of your code:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.HashMap;\nimport java.util.Map;\n\npublic class OrderProcessor {\n    private Map<String, Integer> priceList;\n\n    public OrderProcessor() {\n        // Initialize the price list with some example data\n        priceList = new HashMap<>();\n        priceList.put(\"apple\", 1);\n        priceList.put(\"banana\", 2);\n        priceList.put(\"orange\", 3);\n    }\n\n    public int calculateOrderPrice(String orderString) {\n        // Split the order string into parts\n        String[] orderData = orderString.split(\"\\\\s+\");\n        \n        if (orderData.length < 2) {\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Invalid order format\");\n        }\n        \n        // Split the product details using the hyphen\n        String[] productDetails = orderData[0].split(\"–\");\n        \n        if (productDetails.length != 2) {\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Invalid product format\");\n        }\n        \n        String productName = productDetails[1];\n        int quantity = Integer.parseInt(orderData[1]);\n        \n        // Get the price of the product from the price list\n        if (!priceList.containsKey(productName)) {\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Product not found: \" + productName);\n        }\n        \n        int productPrice = priceList.get(productName);\n        int orderPrice = quantity * productPrice;\n        \n        return orderPrice;\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        OrderProcessor processor = new OrderProcessor();\n        String orderString = \"1 apple–2\";\n        int totalOrderPrice = processor.calculateOrderPrice(orderString);\n        System.out.println(\"Total order price: \" + totalOrderPrice);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Initialization**: The `priceList` is initialized with some example data.\n2. **Splitting the Order String**: The `orderString` is split into parts using spaces as delimiters.\n3. **Product Details Splitting**: The first part of the order string (before the space) is further split using a hyphen to separate the quantity and product name.\n4. **Price Retrieval**: The price of the product is retrieved from the `priceList`.\n5. **Order Price Calculation**: The total order price is calculated by multiplying the quantity by the product price.\n\nThis code ensures that the order string is correctly parsed, and it handles potential errors such as invalid formats or missing products in the price list.",
