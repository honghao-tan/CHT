        "content": "To separate the query from the modifier, we can create a method named `getTotalOutstanding` that calculates the total outstanding amount without sending the bill. Then, we can call this method in the original method to get the total outstanding amount and then send the bill.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```java\npublic double getTotalOutstanding() {\n    double result = 0;\n    for (Invoice each : customer.getInvoices()) {\n        result += each.getAmount();\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n\npublic void sendBill() {\n    // Code to send the bill\n}\n\npublic double getTotalOutstandingAndSendBill() {\n    double totalOutstanding = getTotalOutstanding();\n    sendBill();\n    return totalOutstanding;\n}\n```\n\nIn this refactored code, `getTotalOutstanding` is a pure query method that calculates and returns the total outstanding amount without any side effects. The `sendBill` method handles the sending of the bill. Finally, in `getTotalOutstandingAndSendBill`, we first call `getTotalOutstanding` to get the total outstanding amount and then call `sendBill` to send the bill. This separation makes the code more modular and easier to understand.",

        "content": " It looks like you're trying to split an order string and extract the necessary information to calculate the total price of an order. However, there are a few issues in your code that need to be addressed:\n\n1. The `orderString` should be passed as a parameter to the method.\n2. The `priceList` should be passed as a parameter to the method.\n3. The method should return the calculated order price.\n\nHere's a revised version of your code with these changes:\n\n```java\npublic class OrderProcessor {\n    public static int calculateOrderPrice(String orderString, Map<String, Integer> priceList) {\n        // Split the order string into individual parts\n        String[] orderData = orderString.split(\"\\\\s+\");\n        \n        // Split the product details to extract the product name and quantity\n        String[] productDetails = orderData[0].split(\"–\");\n        \n        // Get the product price from the price list\n        int productPrice = priceList.get(productDetails[1]);\n        \n        // Calculate the total order price\n        int orderPrice = Integer.parseInt(orderData[1]) * productPrice;\n        \n        return orderPrice;\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Example usage\n        Map<String, Integer> priceList = new HashMap<>();\n        priceList.put(\"apple\", 1);\n        priceList.put(\"banana\", 2);\n        priceList.put(\"orange\", 3);\n\n        String orderString = \"apple–2 5\";\n        int totalOrderPrice = calculateOrderPrice(orderString, priceList);\n        System.out.println(\"Total Order Price: \" + totalOrderPrice);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Method Signature**: The `calculateOrderPrice` method takes two parameters: `orderString` (the order data as a string) and `priceList` (a map containing product names and their prices).\n2. **Splitting the Order String**: The `orderString` is split into individual parts using `split(\"\\\\s+\")`.\n3. **Extracting Product Details**: The first part of the `orderData` array is further split to extract the product name and quantity.\n4. **Getting Product Price**: The product price is retrieved from the `priceList` map.\n5. **Calculating Total Order Price**: The total order price is calculated by multiplying the product price by the quantity.\n6. **Returning the Result**: The method returns the calculated total order price.\n\nThis approach ensures that your code is modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.",
