        "content": " It looks like you're trying to split an order string and extract the necessary details to calculate the total price. However, there are a few issues in your code that need to be addressed:\n\n1. The `orderString` should be passed as a parameter to the method.\n2. The `priceList` should be passed as a parameter to the method.\n3. The method should return the calculated order price.\n\nHere's a revised version of your code with these changes:\n\n```java\npublic class OrderProcessor {\n    public static int calculateOrderPrice(String orderString, Map<String, Integer> priceList) {\n        // Split the order string into parts\n        String[] orderData = orderString.split(\"\\\\s+\");\n        \n        // Split the product details to extract the product name and quantity\n        String[] productDetails = orderData[0].split(\"–\");\n        \n        // Get the product price from the price list\n        int productPrice = priceList.get(productDetails[1]);\n        \n        // Calculate the total order price\n        int orderPrice = Integer.parseInt(orderData[1]) * productPrice;\n        \n        return orderPrice;\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Example usage\n        Map<String, Integer> priceList = new HashMap<>();\n        priceList.put(\"apple\", 5);\n        priceList.put(\"banana\", 3);\n\n        String orderString = \"1 apple–2\";\n        int totalOrderPrice = calculateOrderPrice(orderString, priceList);\n        System.out.println(\"Total Order Price: \" + totalOrderPrice);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Method Signature**: The `calculateOrderPrice` method takes two parameters: `orderString` and `priceList`.\n2. **Splitting the Order String**: The `orderString` is split into parts using `\\\\s+` to handle any whitespace.\n3. **Extracting Product Details**: The product details are further split using `\"–\"` to separate the quantity and product name.\n4. **Getting Product Price**: The price of the product is retrieved from the `priceList`.\n5. **Calculating Total Order Price**: The total order price is calculated by multiplying the quantity with the product price.\n6. **Returning the Result**: The method returns the calculated total order price.\n\nThis approach ensures that your code is modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.",
