This new class will encapsulate the behavior of the `Department` class and provide a more focused interface for interacting with it. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Create a new class `BuildTheWall`.\n2. Add a private field to hold an instance of `Department`.\n3. Provide methods in `BuildTheWall` that delegate to the `Department` instance but encapsulate the logic if necessary.\n\nHere's the refactored code:\n\n```java\npublic class BuildTheWall {\n    private Department department;\n\n    public BuildTheWall(String manager) {\n        this.department = new Department(manager);\n    }\n\n    // Delegate method to get the manager from the Department\n    public String getManager() {\n        return department.getManager();\n    }\n\n    // Delegate method to set the manager in the Department\n    public void setManager(String manager) {\n        department.setManager(manager);\n    }\n\n    // Additional methods can be added here if needed\n}\n```\n\nIn this refactored version, the `BuildTheWall` class encapsulates a `Department` object and provides a simple interface to interact with it. This approach hides the delegation details from the client code, making the API cleaner and more focused on the specific behavior of building walls rather than managing departments.",
