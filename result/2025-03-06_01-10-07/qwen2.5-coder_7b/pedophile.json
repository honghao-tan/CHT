The `sendBill` method takes the total outstanding amount as a parameter and handles the logic to send the bill. Finally, in the `getTotalOutstandingAndSendBill` method, you call `getTotalOutstanding` to get the total outstanding amount and then pass it to `sendBill`.",

However, there are some issues in your code that need to be addressed:\n\n1. The `orderString` is not defined.\n2. The `priceList` is not defined or initialized.\n3. The method name \"pedophile\" doesn't seem appropriate for this context.\n\nLet's correct and improve the code:\n\n```java\npublic class OrderProcessor {\n    private Map<String, Integer> priceList;\n\n    public OrderProcessor(Map<String, Integer> priceList) {\n        this.priceList = priceList;\n    }\n\n    public int processOrder(String orderString) {\n        // Split the order string into parts\n        String[] orderData = orderString.split(\"\\\\s+\");\n        \n        // Extract product details and quantity from the order data\n        String[] productDetails = orderData[0].split(\"–\");\n        int quantity = Integer.parseInt(orderData[1]);\n        \n        // Get the product price from the price list\n        int productPrice = priceList.getOrDefault(productDetails[1], 0);\n        \n        // Calculate the total order price\n        int orderPrice = quantity * productPrice;\n        \n        return orderPrice;\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Example usage\n        Map<String, Integer> priceList = new HashMap<>();\n        priceList.put(\"product1\", 10);\n        priceList.put(\"product2\", 20);\n\n        OrderProcessor processor = new OrderProcessor(priceList);\n        \n        String orderString = \"product1–2\";\n        int totalOrderPrice = processor.processOrder(orderString);\n        \n        System.out.println(\"Total Order Price: \" + totalOrderPrice);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Class and Method Structure**: The code is encapsulated in a class `OrderProcessor` with a method `processOrder`.\n2. **Constructor**: The constructor initializes the `priceList`.\n3. **Method Logic**:\n   - Splits the `orderString` into parts.\n   - Extracts product details and quantity.\n   - Retrieves the product price from the `priceList`.\n   - Calculates the total order price.\n4. **Example Usage**: Demonstrates how to use the `OrderProcessor` class with a sample `orderString`.\n\nThis approach is more modular, easier to test, and follows better coding practices.",
