Create a new class `EatingDisorderPromotion`.\n2. Move the relevant fields and methods from `Department` to `EatingDisorderPromotion`.\n3. Provide a constructor, getters, and setters for the new class.\n4. Optionally, add any additional methods or logic specific to eating disorder promotions.\n\nHere's an example of how you might refactor the code:\n\n```java\npublic class EatingDisorderPromotion {\n    private String manager;\n\n    public EatingDisorderPromotion(String manager) {\n        this.manager = manager;\n    }\n\n    public String getManager() {\n        return manager;\n    }\n\n    public void setManager(String manager) {\n        this.manager = manager;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this refactored code, the `EatingDisorderPromotion` class encapsulates the functionality of the `Department` class and provides a more focused interface for managing eating disorder promotions. This approach helps to hide the delegation of the department and makes it clear that the class is specifically designed for managing eating disorder promotions.",

Modify the `Stack` class to use an instance of `eatingDisOrderPromotion`.\n\nHere's an example implementation in Java:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.List;\n\n// Delegate class for handling list operations\nclass eatingDisOrderPromotion {\n    private List<Object> items = new ArrayList<>();\n\n    public void push(Object item) {\n        items.add(item);\n    }\n\n    public Object pop() {\n        if (items.isEmpty()) {\n            throw new IllegalStateException(\"Stack is empty\");\n        }\n        return items.remove(items.size() - 1);\n    }\n\n    public boolean isEmpty() {\n        return items.isEmpty();\n    }\n\n    public int size() {\n        return items.size();\n    }\n}\n\n// Stack class using the delegate\nclass Stack {\n    private eatingDisOrderPromotion delegate = new eatingDisOrderPromotion();\n\n    public void push(Object item) {\n        delegate.push(item);\n    }\n\n    public Object pop() {\n        return delegate.pop();\n    }\n\n    public boolean isEmpty() {\n        return delegate.isEmpty();\n    }\n\n    public int size() {\n        return delegate.size();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The `eatingDisOrderPromotion` class encapsulates the list operations using an `ArrayList`.\n- The `Stack` class uses an instance of `eatingDisOrderPromotion` to perform its operations, effectively delegating the list management to the `eatingDisOrderPromotion` class.\n\nThis approach allows you to separate the concerns and makes it easier to modify or replace the delegate implementation if needed.",
