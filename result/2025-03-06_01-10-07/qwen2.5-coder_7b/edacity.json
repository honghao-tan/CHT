        "content": "To replace the type code with subclasses, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Create an abstract base class `Employee` that defines common properties and methods.\n2. Create subclasses for each specific type of employee (e.g., Manager, Engineer, etc.).\n\nHere's how you can implement this in Java:\n\n```java\n// Abstract base class for all employees\npublic abstract class Employee {\n    protected String name;\n\n    public Employee(String name) {\n        this.name = name;\n    }\n\n    // Common method that all employees can perform\n    public void work() {\n        System.out.println(name + \" is working.\");\n    }\n\n    // Abstract method to be implemented by subclasses\n    public abstract void doWork();\n}\n\n// Subclass for Manager type of employee\npublic class Manager extends Employee {\n    public Manager(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void doWork() {\n        System.out.println(name + \" is managing the team.\");\n    }\n}\n\n// Subclass for Engineer type of employee\npublic class Engineer extends Employee {\n    public Engineer(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void doWork() {\n        System.out.println(name + \" is coding.\");\n    }\n}\n\n// Factory method to create employees based on the type\npublic class EmployeeFactory {\n    public static Employee createEmployee(String name, String type) {\n        switch (type.toLowerCase()) {\n            case \"manager\":\n                return new Manager(name);\n            case \"engineer\":\n                return new Engineer(name);\n            default:\n                throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Unknown employee type: \" + type);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Employee manager = EmployeeFactory.createEmployee(\"John Doe\", \"Manager\");\n        Employee engineer = EmployeeFactory.createEmployee(\"Jane Smith\", \"Engineer\");\n\n        manager.work(); // Output: John Doe is working.\n        manager.doWork(); // Output: John Doe is managing the team.\n\n        engineer.work(); // Output: Jane Smith is working.\n        engineer.doWork(); // Output: Jane Smith is coding.\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we have an abstract base class `Employee` with a common method `work()`. We then create two subclasses, `Manager` and `Engineer`, each implementing the `doWork()` method specific to their role. The `EmployeeFactory` class provides a factory method to create instances of different employee types based on the type code passed as a parameter. This approach adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and makes it easier to extend or modify the system in the future.",

If the product is not found, it returns 0.\n\n3. **Main Method**:\n   - Creates an instance of `Edacity`.\n   - Splits the `orderString` to extract the product name and quantity.\n   - Calls `getProductPrice` method to get the price of the product.\n   - Calculates the total order price by multiplying the product price with the quantity.\n\nThis approach encapsulates the logic for querying prices within a class, making it reusable and easier to manage.",
