Records are a feature introduced in Java 14 as a preview feature and later promoted to standard in Java 16.

        "content": "To replace the superclass with a delegate in Java, you can create a new class called `spicspeak` that holds an instance of the original superclass (`List`). This way, you can delegate method calls to the `List` instance. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```java\nclass List {\n    // ... (original implementation)\n}\n\nclass spicspeak {\n    private List list;\n\n    public spicspeak() {\n        this.list = new List();\n    }\n\n    // Delegate methods from List to spicspeak\n    public void add(Object item) {\n        list.add(item);\n    }\n\n    public Object get(int index) {\n        return list.get(index);\n    }\n\n    public int size() {\n        return list.size();\n    }\n\n    // Add other necessary methods here\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `spicspeak` class has a private field of type `List`. The constructor initializes this field with a new instance of `List`. Then, it delegates method calls to the `list` field. This way, you can use the `spicspeak` class as if it were an instance of `List`, but with additional functionality or behavior if needed.",
