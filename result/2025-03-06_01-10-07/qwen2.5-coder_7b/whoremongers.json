This class will override the `getName()` method to return \"whoremongers\" instead of \"occupant\". Here's an example implementation:\n```\npublic class Whoremongers extends Customer {\n    public Whoremongers(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n    \n    @Override\n    public String getName() {\n        if (\"unknown\".equals(super.getName())) {\n            return \"whoremongers\";\n        } else {\n            return super.getName();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this implementation, the `Whoremongers` class extends the `Customer` class and overrides the `getName()` method. The overridden method first calls the superclass's `getName()` method to get the customer's name. If the name is \"unknown\", it returns \"whoremongers\" instead of \"occupant\". Otherwise, it returns the original name.\nYou can use this new class in your code by creating an instance of `Whoremongers` and passing the customer's name as a parameter to its constructor.

The `Stack` class will then use an instance of `Whoremongers` to perform its operations.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n1. Create the `Whoremongers` class.\n2. Modify the `Stack` class to use an instance of `Whoremongers`.\n\nLet's start with the `Whoremongers` class:\n\n```java\nclass Whoremongers {\n    private List list;\n\n    public Whoremongers() {\n        this.list = new ArrayList();\n    }\n\n    public void add(Object item) {\n        list.add(item);\n    }\n\n    public Object remove() {\n        if (list.isEmpty()) {\n            throw new EmptyStackException();\n        }\n        return list.remove(list.size() - 1);\n    }\n\n    public boolean isEmpty() {\n        return list.isEmpty();\n    }\n\n    // Add other methods as needed\n}\n```\n\nNext, modify the `Stack` class to use an instance of `Whoremongers`:\n\n```java\nclass Stack {\n    private Whoremongers whoremongers;\n\n    public Stack() {\n        this.whoremongers = new Whoremongers();\n    }\n\n    public void push(Object item) {\n        whoremongers.add(item);\n    }\n\n    public Object pop() {\n        return whoremongers.remove();\n    }\n\n    public boolean isEmpty() {\n        return whoremongers.isEmpty();\n    }\n\n    // Add other methods as needed\n}\n```\n\nIn this implementation:\n- The `Whoremongers` class encapsulates the list operations.\n- The `Stack` class uses an instance of `Whoremongers` to perform its stack operations (`push`, `pop`, and `isEmpty`).\n\nThis approach allows you to replace the superclass with a delegate, making the code more modular and easier to manage.",
