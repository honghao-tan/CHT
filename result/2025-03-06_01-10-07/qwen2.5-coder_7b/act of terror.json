Move the relevant properties and methods from the `Department` class to the `ActOfTerror` class.\n3. Ensure that the `ActOfTerror` class encapsulates the behavior properly.\n\nHere is the refactored code:\n\n```java\npublic class ActOfTerror {\n    private String manager;\n\n    public ActOfTerror(String manager) {\n        this.manager = manager;\n    }\n\n    public String getManager() {\n        return manager;\n    }\n\n    public void setManager(String manager) {\n        this.manager = manager;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this refactored version, the `Department` class has been renamed to `ActOfTerror`, and it still contains the same properties and methods. This encapsulation helps in hiding the delegation of the department's manager from other parts of the codebase.\n\nIf you need to use the `Department` class for some reason, you can create a new instance of `ActOfTerror` with the appropriate manager:\n\n```java\npublic class Department {\n    private ActOfTerror actOfTerror;\n\n    public Department(String manager) {\n        this.actOfTerror = new ActOfTerror(manager);\n    }\n\n    public String getManager() {\n        return actOfTerror.getManager();\n    }\n\n    public void setManager(String manager) {\n        actOfTerror.setManager(manager);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis way, the `Department` class still uses an instance of `ActOfTerror` internally to manage the manager property, but it hides this implementation detail from external users.",

        "content": "To replace the superclass `List` with a delegate in the `Stack` class, we can create an instance of `List` within the `Stack` class and use it to handle the list operations. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```java\nclass List {\n    // ... (existing methods and fields)\n}\n\nclass Stack {\n    private List delegate;\n\n    public Stack() {\n        this.delegate = new List();\n    }\n\n    // Delegate methods from List to the delegate instance\n    public void add(Object item) {\n        delegate.add(item);\n    }\n\n    public Object remove() {\n        return delegate.remove();\n    }\n\n    public boolean isEmpty() {\n        return delegate.isEmpty();\n    }\n\n    // Add other necessary methods as needed\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, `Stack` has a private field `delegate` of type `List`. The constructor initializes this field with a new instance of `List`. All the methods from `List` are then delegated to the `delegate` object. This way, `Stack` can use the functionalities provided by `List` without inheriting from it directly.\n\nThis approach allows you to change the implementation of `List` later without affecting the `Stack` class, adhering to the principles of composition over inheritance.",

Create subclasses for each specific type of employee.\n3. Modify the `createEmployee` method to instantiate the appropriate subclass based on the type.\n\nHere's an example implementation in Java:\n\n```java\n// Base class for all employees\npublic abstract class Employee {\n    protected String name;\n\n    public Employee(String name) {\n        this.name = name;\n    }\n\n    // Abstract method that subclasses must implement\n    public abstract void performTask();\n}\n\n// Subclass for regular employees\npublic class RegularEmployee extends Employee {\n    public RegularEmployee(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void performTask() {\n        System.out.println(name + \" is performing a regular task.\");\n    }\n}\n\n// Subclass for managers\npublic class Manager extends Employee {\n    public Manager(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void performTask() {\n        System.out.println(name + \" is managing the team.\");\n    }\n}\n\n// Subclass for executives\npublic class Executive extends Employee {\n    public Executive(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void performTask() {\n        System.out.println(name + \" is making strategic decisions.\");\n    }\n}\n\n// Factory method to create employees based on type\npublic class EmployeeFactory {\n    public static Employee createEmployee(String name, String type) {\n        switch (type.toLowerCase()) {\n            case \"regular\":\n                return new RegularEmployee(name);\n            case \"manager\":\n                return new Manager(name);\n            case \"executive\":\n                return new Executive(name);\n            default:\n                throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Unknown employee type: \" + type);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Employee regular = EmployeeFactory.createEmployee(\"John Doe\", \"regular\");\n        Employee manager = EmployeeFactory.createEmployee(\"Jane Smith\", \"manager\");\n        Employee executive = EmployeeFactory.createEmployee(\"Alice Johnson\", \"executive\");\n\n        regular.performTask();\n        manager.performTask();\n        executive.performTask();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The `Employee` class is an abstract base class with a method `performTask()` that must be implemented by subclasses.\n- Subclasses `RegularEmployee`, `Manager`, and `Executive` each provide their own implementation of the `performTask()` method.\n- The `EmployeeFactory` class contains a static method `createEmployee()` that creates instances of the appropriate subclass based on the type provided.\n\nThis approach allows you to easily extend the system with new employee types by adding new subclasses without modifying existing code.",
