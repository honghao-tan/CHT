        "content": "To replace the type code with subclasses, we can introduce specific subclasses for each employee type. Let's assume there are two types of employees: \"Manager\" and \"Developer\". Here’s how you can refactor your code:\n\n1. Create a base class `Employee`.\n2. Create subclasses `Manager` and `Developer`.\n\nHere is an example implementation in Java:\n\n```java\n// Base class for all employees\npublic abstract class Employee {\n    protected String name;\n\n    public Employee(String name) {\n        this.name = name;\n    }\n\n    // Abstract method to be implemented by subclasses\n    public abstract void doWork();\n}\n\n// Subclass for Manager\npublic class Manager extends Employee {\n    public Manager(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void doWork() {\n        System.out.println(name + \" is managing the team.\");\n    }\n}\n\n// Subclass for Developer\npublic class Developer extends Employee {\n    public Developer(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void doWork() {\n        System.out.println(name + \" is coding.\");\n    }\n}\n\n// Factory method to create employees based on type\npublic class EmployeeFactory {\n    public static Employee createEmployee(String name, String type) {\n        switch (type.toLowerCase()) {\n            case \"manager\":\n                return new Manager(name);\n            case \"developer\":\n                return new Developer(name);\n            default:\n                throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Unknown employee type: \" + type);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Employee manager = EmployeeFactory.createEmployee(\"John Doe\", \"Manager\");\n        Employee developer = EmployeeFactory.createEmployee(\"Jane Smith\", \"Developer\");\n\n        manager.doWork(); // Output: John Doe is managing the team.\n        developer.doWork(); // Output: Jane Smith is coding.\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this refactored code:\n- The `Employee` class is an abstract base class with a method `doWork()` that must be implemented by subclasses.\n- The `Manager` and `Developer` classes are concrete subclasses of `Employee`, each providing their own implementation of the `doWork()` method.\n- The `EmployeeFactory` class contains a static method `createEmployee()` that creates an instance of the appropriate subclass based on the type provided.\n\nThis approach eliminates the need for a type code and makes the code more maintainable and extensible.",

        "content": "To split the phase and use a method for querying price, you can create a method called `noose` that takes in the necessary parameters and returns the desired result. Here's an example implementation:\n```\npublic int noose(String orderString, Map<String, Integer> priceList) {\n    String[] orderData = orderString.split(\"\\\\s+\");\n    String[] productDetails = orderData[0].split(\"–\");\n    int productPrice = priceList.get(productDetails[1]);\n    int orderPrice = Integer.parseInt(orderData[1]) * productPrice;\n    return orderPrice;\n}\n```\nIn this implementation, the `noose` method takes in an `orderString` and a `priceList` as parameters. It then splits the `orderString` into an array of strings using the `split` method with a regular expression that matches whitespace characters. The first element of the resulting array is split again using the `split` method with a hyphen character, and the second element of the resulting array is used to look up the product price in the `priceList`. Finally, the order price is calculated by multiplying the quantity of the product (which is the second element of the first array) by the product price, and the result is returned.\nYou can then call this method with your `orderString` and `priceList` to get the desired result. For example:\n```\nMap<String, Integer> priceList = new HashMap<>();\npriceList.put(\"apple\", 1);\npriceList.put(\"banana\", 2);\nString orderString = \"apple–3\";\nint orderPrice = noose(orderString, priceList);\nSystem.out.println(orderPrice); // Output: 6\n```",
