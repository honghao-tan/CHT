A record is a special kind of class that is designed to encapsulate data. It automatically generates methods like `toString()`, `equals()`, and `hashCode()` based on its fields.\n\nHere's an example of how you can create a new parameter object named `Person`:\n\n```java\nrecord Person(String name, int age) {\n    // You can add custom methods here if needed\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, `Person` is a record with two fields: `name` and `age`. The constructor is automatically generated based on the fields. You can create an instance of `Person` like this:\n\n```java\nPerson person = new Person(\"John Doe\", 30);\nSystem.out.println(person); // Output: Person[name=John Doe, age=30]\n```\n\nThis approach simplifies the creation and management of data objects in your Java applications.",

Here's an example in Java:\n\n```java\n// Base class\npublic abstract class Employee {\n    protected String name;\n\n    public Employee(String name) {\n        this.name = name;\n    }\n\n    // Abstract method to be implemented by subclasses\n    public abstract void work();\n}\n\n// Subclass for a specific type of employee (e.g., Manager)\npublic class Manager extends Employee {\n    public Manager(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void work() {\n        System.out.println(name + \" is managing the team.\");\n    }\n}\n\n// Subclass for another specific type of employee (e.g., Developer)\npublic class Developer extends Employee {\n    public Developer(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void work() {\n        System.out.println(name + \" is coding.\");\n    }\n}\n\n// Factory method to create employees based on the type\npublic Employee createEmployee(String name, String type) {\n    switch (type.toLowerCase()) {\n        case \"manager\":\n            return new Manager(name);\n        case \"developer\":\n            return new Developer(name);\n        default:\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Unknown employee type: \" + type);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `createEmployee` method uses a factory pattern to create instances of different subclasses based on the `type` parameter. Each subclass implements the `work` method, which defines what each type of employee does. This approach eliminates the need for a type code and makes the code more maintainable and scalable.",
