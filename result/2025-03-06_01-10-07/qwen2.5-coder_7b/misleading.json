The record is annotated with `@SuppressWarnings(\"preview\")` to indicate that it uses a feature that is still under preview and may change in future versions of the language.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the code:\n\n1. **Record Declaration**: \n   ```java\n   record R(int i) {\n   ```\n   This line declares a new record type named `R` with one component field `i`.\n\n2. **Compact Constructor**:\n   ```java\n   R {\n       System.out.println(\"Compact Constructor\");\n   }\n   ```\n   This is a compact constructor for the record. Compact constructors are a feature introduced in Java 14 that allow you to initialize the component fields without explicitly calling a superclass constructor or initializing them in the field declaration.\n\n3. **Output**:\n   When an instance of `R` is created, the compact constructor will print \"Compact Constructor\" to the console.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nHere's how you might use this record type:\n\n```java\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        R r = new R(42);\n        System.out.println(\"Value of i: \" + r.i());\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWhen you run the `Main` class, it will output:\n```\nCompact Constructor\nValue of i: 42\n```\n\n### Misleading Name\n\nThe name `R` is intentionally misleading because it does not clearly indicate what the record represents or what its purpose is. A more descriptive name would help other developers understand the intent behind the record type.\n\nFor example, if this record were intended to represent a point in a 2D space, a more appropriate name might be `Point2D` or `Coordinate`.\n\n### Summary\n\n- **Record Type**: `R`\n- **Component Field**: `i` (of type `int`)\n- **Compact Constructor**: Prints \"Compact Constructor\" when an instance is created\n- **Misleading Name**: The name `R` does not clearly indicate the purpose of the record.\n\nThis example demonstrates how to use a compact constructor in a record and highlights the importance of choosing meaningful names for types.",

This new class will provide a more meaningful name and hide the direct access to the `manager` field.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n1. Create a new class named `MisleadingDepartment`.\n2. In this new class, encapsulate the `Department` object.\n3. Provide methods in the new class that delegate to the `Department` object but with a more meaningful name or additional logic if needed.\n\nHere's an example of how you can implement this:\n\n```java\npublic class MisleadingDepartment {\n    private Department department;\n\n    public MisleadingDepartment(String manager) {\n        this.department = new Department(manager);\n    }\n\n    // Method to get the manager, providing a more meaningful name\n    public String getManagerName() {\n        return department.getManager();\n    }\n\n    // Method to set the manager, providing additional logic if needed\n    public void setManagerName(String manager) {\n        // Additional logic can be added here if required\n        department.setManager(manager);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this refactored version:\n- The `MisleadingDepartment` class encapsulates a `Department` object.\n- The `getManagerName` method provides a more meaningful name for retrieving the manager's name.\n- The `setManagerName` method allows setting the manager's name and can include additional logic if needed.\n\nThis approach hides the direct access to the `manager` field and provides a more controlled interface, making the code easier to understand and maintain.",

We will name these subclasses misleadingly to make it clear that they are not what they seem.\n\nHere is how you can refactor the code:\n\n1. Create a base class `Employee`.\n2. Create subclass `MisleadingManager` for type \"Manager\".\n3. Create subclass `MisleadingDeveloper` for type \"Developer\".\n\n```java\npublic abstract class Employee {\n    protected String name;\n\n    public Employee(String name) {\n        this.name = name;\n    }\n\n    public abstract void work();\n}\n\npublic class MisleadingManager extends Employee {\n    public MisleadingManager(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void work() {\n        System.out.println(\"MisleadingManager is managing the team.\");\n    }\n}\n\npublic class MisleadingDeveloper extends Employee {\n    public MisleadingDeveloper(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void work() {\n        System.out.println(\"MisleadingDeveloper is coding.\");\n    }\n}\n\npublic class EmployeeFactory {\n    public static Employee createEmployee(String name, String type) {\n        if (\"Manager\".equals(type)) {\n            return new MisleadingManager(name);\n        } else if (\"Developer\".equals(type)) {\n            return new MisleadingDeveloper(name);\n        } else {\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Unknown employee type: \" + type);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Employee manager = createEmployee(\"John Doe\", \"Manager\");\n        manager.work(); // Output: MisleadingManager is managing the team.\n\n        Employee developer = createEmployee(\"Jane Smith\", \"Developer\");\n        developer.work(); // Output: MisleadingDeveloper is coding.\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this refactored code:\n- The `Employee` class is an abstract base class with a method `work()` that needs to be implemented by subclasses.\n- The `MisleadingManager` and `MisleadingDeveloper` classes are subclasses of `Employee` and provide specific implementations of the `work()` method.\n- The `EmployeeFactory` class contains a static method `createEmployee()` that creates instances of the appropriate subclass based on the type provided.\n\nThis approach ensures that each employee type is clearly represented by its own subclass, making the code more maintainable and easier to understand.",

The `getTotalOutstanding` method only queries the data without modifying it, while the `sendBill` method handles the modification of sending the bill.",
