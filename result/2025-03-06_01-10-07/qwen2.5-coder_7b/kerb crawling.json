This object is implemented using Java's record class, which provides an easy way to create immutable data classes with minimal boilerplate code.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the `R` record class:\n\n1. **Record Declaration**: The class is declared as a record using the `record` keyword. Records are introduced in Java 14 and provide a concise syntax for creating classes that are primarily used to store data.\n\n2. **Constructor**: The record automatically generates a constructor that takes parameters corresponding to its components. In this case, it has one parameter `i`.\n\n3. **Compact Constructor**: Inside the record, there is a compact constructor defined using `{}`. This block of code runs every time an instance of the record is created. It's used here to print \"Compact Constructor\" to the console when a new instance of `R` is created.\n\n4. **Immutability**: Records are inherently immutable, meaning once an instance is created, its fields cannot be changed. This ensures thread safety and simplifies reasoning about the state of objects.\n\nHere's how you might use this record in your code:\n\n```java\npublic class KerberosCrawler {\n    public void crawl(R kerbCrawling) {\n        // Use the value of i from the kerbCrawling parameter object\n        int i = kerbCrawling.i();\n        System.out.println(\"Starting Kerberos crawling with parameter: \" + i);\n        // Perform the actual crawling logic here\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        KerberosCrawler crawler = new KerberosCrawler();\n        R kerbParams = new R(42); // Create an instance of R with i = 42\n        crawler.crawl(kerbParams);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `KerberosCrawler` class has a method `crawl` that takes a `R` object as a parameter. The `main` method creates an instance of `R` with `i` set to 42 and passes it to the `crawl` method.\n\nThis design ensures that the parameters for the Kerberos crawling operation are encapsulated within a single, immutable object, making the code more readable and maintainable.",

This new class will encapsulate the behavior of the `Department` class and provide a more controlled interface to interact with it. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Create a new class `KerbCrawling`.\n2. Add a private field of type `Department` in the `KerbCrawling` class.\n3. Provide public methods in `KerbCrawling` that delegate to the corresponding methods of the `Department` class.\n\nHere's the refactored code:\n\n```java\npublic class KerbCrawling {\n    private Department department;\n\n    public KerbCrawling(String manager) {\n        this.department = new Department(manager);\n    }\n\n    public String getManager() {\n        return department.getManager();\n    }\n\n    public void setManager(String manager) {\n        department.setManager(manager);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this refactored version, the `KerbCrawling` class encapsulates a `Department` object and provides a controlled interface to interact with it. This way, you can hide the delegation of the `Department` class and provide a more controlled and flexible API for interacting with departments.",

The `Stack` class then uses an instance of `kerbCrawling` to implement its own methods while still utilizing the functionality provided by the original `List`. This approach allows you to maintain the behavior of the original classes while potentially adding additional functionality or modifying existing behavior through the delegate pattern.",
