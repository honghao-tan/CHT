Records are implicitly final and their fields are implicitly final as well.\n\n2. **Compact Constructor**:\n   - The constructor inside the record is called a \"compact constructor.\" It's used to initialize the record components.\n   - In this case, the compact constructor simply prints \"Compact Constructor\" when an instance of `R` is created.\n\n3. **@SuppressWarnings(\"preview\")**:\n   - This annotation suppresses warnings related to the use of preview features in Java. Records are a preview feature as of Java 14, so using them without this annotation might result in warnings.\n\n### Usage Example:\n\nHere's how you can create an instance of the `R` record and use it:\n\n```java\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        R r = new R(10);\n        System.out.println(\"Value of i: \" + r.i());\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Output:\n```\nCompact Constructor\nValue of i: 10\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- **Immutability**: Records are designed to be immutable, meaning once an instance is created, its fields cannot be changed.\n- **Simplicity**: They provide a concise way to define classes that primarily hold data.\n- **Performance**: Records can offer performance benefits due to their compact nature and the optimizations made by the Java compiler.\n\nRecords are particularly useful in scenarios where you need to pass around small pieces of data, such as coordinates, status codes, or configuration settings.",

        "content": "To replace the type code with subclasses, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a base class `Employee` that will serve as the superclass for all employee types.\n2. Create subclasses for each specific type of employee (e.g., `Manager`, `Developer`, etc.).\n\nHere's an example implementation in Java:\n\n```java\n// Base class for all employees\npublic abstract class Employee {\n    protected String name;\n\n    public Employee(String name) {\n        this.name = name;\n    }\n\n    // Abstract method to be implemented by subclasses\n    public abstract void work();\n}\n\n// Subclass for Manager type of employee\npublic class Manager extends Employee {\n    public Manager(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void work() {\n        System.out.println(name + \" is managing the team.\");\n    }\n}\n\n// Subclass for Developer type of employee\npublic class Developer extends Employee {\n    public Developer(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void work() {\n        System.out.println(name + \" is coding.\");\n    }\n}\n\n// Factory method to create employees based on the type\npublic class EmployeeFactory {\n    public static Employee createEmployee(String name, String type) {\n        switch (type.toLowerCase()) {\n            case \"manager\":\n                return new Manager(name);\n            case \"developer\":\n                return new Developer(name);\n            // Add more cases for other employee types as needed\n            default:\n                throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Unknown employee type: \" + type);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Employee manager = EmployeeFactory.createEmployee(\"John Doe\", \"Manager\");\n        Employee developer = EmployeeFactory.createEmployee(\"Jane Smith\", \"Developer\");\n\n        manager.work(); // Output: John Doe is managing the team.\n        developer.work(); // Output: Jane Smith is coding.\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `Employee` class is an abstract base class with a method `work()` that must be implemented by subclasses. The `Manager` and `Developer` classes are concrete subclasses of `Employee` that provide specific implementations of the `work()` method.\n\nThe `EmployeeFactory` class contains a static method `createEmployee()` that takes a name and type as parameters and returns an instance of the appropriate subclass based on the type. This approach eliminates the need for a type code and makes it easier to add new employee types in the future.",
