When the name is \"unknown\", it returns a specific value (e.g., \"special occupant\"). Otherwise, it calls the superclass's `getName()` method to return the original name.\n\nYou can use the `Doxing` class in your code like this:\n\n```java\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Customer customer1 = new Customer(\"John\");\n        System.out.println(customer1.getName()); // Output: John\n\n        Doxing doxingCustomer = new Doxing(\"unknown\");\n        System.out.println(doxingCustomer.getName()); // Output: special occupant\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis way, you can handle the special case where the customer's name is \"unknown\" by using the `Doxing` class.",

Here’s how you can refactor your code:\n\n1. Create a base class `Employee`.\n2. Create subclasses `Manager` and `Developer`.\n\nHere is the refactored code:\n\n```java\npublic abstract class Employee {\n    protected String name;\n\n    public Employee(String name) {\n        this.name = name;\n    }\n\n    public abstract void doWork();\n}\n\npublic class Manager extends Employee {\n    public Manager(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void doWork() {\n        System.out.println(name + \" is managing the team.\");\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Developer extends Employee {\n    public Developer(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void doWork() {\n        System.out.println(name + \" is coding.\");\n    }\n}\n\npublic class EmployeeFactory {\n    public static Employee createEmployee(String name, String type) {\n        switch (type.toLowerCase()) {\n            case \"manager\":\n                return new Manager(name);\n            case \"developer\":\n                return new Developer(name);\n            default:\n                throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Unknown employee type: \" + type);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Employee manager = createEmployee(\"John Doe\", \"Manager\");\n        Employee developer = createEmployee(\"Jane Smith\", \"Developer\");\n\n        manager.doWork();\n        developer.doWork();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Base Class (`Employee`)**: This class is abstract and contains a common attribute `name`. It also has an abstract method `doWork()` which must be implemented by subclasses.\n2. **Subclasses (`Manager` and `Developer`)**: These classes extend the `Employee` class and provide specific implementations of the `doWork()` method.\n3. **Factory Class (`EmployeeFactory`)**: This class contains a static method `createEmployee()` that takes a name and type as parameters and returns an instance of the appropriate subclass based on the type.\n\nThis approach eliminates the need for a type code and makes the code more maintainable and scalable. Each employee type has its own behavior encapsulated in its respective subclass.",
