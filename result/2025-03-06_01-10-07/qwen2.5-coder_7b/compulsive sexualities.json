Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Define an abstract base class `Employee`.\n2. Create subclasses for each specific type of employee.\n3. Modify the `createEmployee` method to return instances of these subclasses based on the type.\n\nHere's an example implementation in Java:\n\n```java\n// Abstract base class\npublic abstract class Employee {\n    protected String name;\n\n    public Employee(String name) {\n        this.name = name;\n    }\n\n    // Abstract method that must be implemented by subclasses\n    public abstract void performDuties();\n}\n\n// Subclass for compulsive sexualities\npublic class CompulsiveSexualities extends Employee {\n    public CompulsiveSexualities(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void performDuties() {\n        // Implement the specific duties of a compulsive sexualities employee\n        System.out.println(name + \" is performing compulsive sexual activities.\");\n    }\n}\n\n// Factory method to create employees based on type\npublic class EmployeeFactory {\n    public static Employee createEmployee(String name, String type) {\n        if (\"CompulsiveSexualities\".equalsIgnoreCase(type)) {\n            return new CompulsiveSexualities(name);\n        } else {\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Unknown employee type: \" + type);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Employee emp = EmployeeFactory.createEmployee(\"John Doe\", \"CompulsiveSexualities\");\n        emp.performDuties();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The `Employee` class is an abstract base class with a constructor and an abstract method `performDuties`.\n- The `CompulsiveSexualities` class extends `Employee` and implements the `performDuties` method.\n- The `EmployeeFactory` class contains a static method `createEmployee` that creates instances of `Employee` subclasses based on the type provided.\n\nThis approach allows you to replace the type code with subclasses, making your code more maintainable and scalable.",
