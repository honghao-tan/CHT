Let's assume there are two types of employees: \"Manager\" and \"Developer\".

        "content": " It looks like you're trying to split an order string and extract the necessary details to calculate the total price.

The `priceList` should be passed as a parameter to the method.\n3. The method should return the calculated order price.\n\nHere's a revised version of your code with these improvements:\n\n```java\npublic class OrderProcessor {\n    public static int calculateOrderPrice(String orderString, Map<String, Integer> priceList) {\n        // Split the order string into parts\n        String[] orderData = orderString.split(\"\\\\s+\");\n        \n        // Extract product details and split them further\n        String[] productDetails = orderData[0].split(\"–\");\n        \n        // Get the product price from the price list\n        int productPrice = priceList.get(productDetails[1]);\n        \n        // Calculate the total order price\n        int orderPrice = Integer.parseInt(orderData[1]) * productPrice;\n        \n        return orderPrice;\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Example usage\n        Map<String, Integer> priceList = new HashMap<>();\n        priceList.put(\"apple\", 5);\n        priceList.put(\"banana\", 3);\n\n        String orderString = \"apple–10 2\";\n        int totalOrderPrice = calculateOrderPrice(orderString, priceList);\n        System.out.println(\"Total Order Price: \" + totalOrderPrice);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Method Signature**: The `calculateOrderPrice` method takes two parameters: `orderString` and `priceList`.\n2. **Splitting the Order String**: The `orderString` is split into parts using `\\\\s+`, which matches one or more whitespace characters.\n3. **Extracting Product Details**: The first part of the order data (before the space) is further split using `\"–\"`.\n4. **Getting Product Price**: The product price is retrieved from the `priceList` using the product name.\n5. **Calculating Total Order Price**: The total order price is calculated by multiplying the quantity (extracted from `orderData[1]`) with the product price.\n6. **Returning the Result**: The method returns the calculated total order price.\n\nThis approach ensures that your code is more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.",
