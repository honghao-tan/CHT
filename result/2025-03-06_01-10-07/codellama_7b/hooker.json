The `push` method adds an element to the end of the list, and the `pop` method removes the last element from the list. The `isEmpty` method returns true if the list is empty.\n\nTo use a delegate instead of a superclass, you can create a separate class that implements the desired behavior and then pass an instance of that class to the constructor of the `Stack` class. For example:\n```\nclass Stack {\n    private final List<Integer> list;\n    private final Hooker hooker;\n\n    public Stack(Hooker hooker) {\n        this.list = new ArrayList<>();\n        this.hooker = hooker;\n    }\n\n    public void push(int value) {\n        list.add(value);\n        hooker.onPush(value);\n    }\n\n    public int pop() {\n        int result = list.remove(list.size() - 1);\n        hooker.onPop(result);\n        return result;\n    }\n\n    public boolean isEmpty() {\n        return list.isEmpty();\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this example, the `Stack` class has a private field of type `List<Integer>` called `list`, and a private field of type `Hooker` called `hooker`. The `Hooker` interface defines two methods: `onPush` and `onPop`. When an element is pushed onto the stack, the `push` method calls the `onPush` method on the `hooker` instance with the value that was pushed. Similarly, when an element is popped from the stack, the `pop` method calls the `onPop` method on the `hooker` instance with the value that was popped.\n\nTo use this delegate instead of a superclass, you can create a class that implements the `Hooker` interface and pass an instance of that class to the constructor of the `Stack` class:\n```\nclass MyHooker implements Hooker {\n    @Override\n    public void onPush(int value) {\n        System.out.println(\"Pushed \" + value);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onPop(int value) {\n        System.out.println(\"Popped \" + value);\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this example, the `MyHooker` class implements the `Hooker` interface and overrides the `onPush` and `onPop` methods to print a message when an element is pushed or popped from the stack. You can then create an instance of the `Stack` class with an instance of the `MyHooker` class:\n```\nStack myStack = new Stack(new MyHooker());\nmyStack.push(1); // prints \"Pushed 1\"\nint result = myStack.pop(); // prints \"Popped 1\"\n```",

The first part is stored in the variable `orderData`, and the second part is stored in the variable `productDetails`.\n\nThe `split()` method returns an array of strings, where each element in the array corresponds to a substring in the original string. In this case, the first element in the array is the entire input string, and the second element is the substring that occurs after the first occurrence of the `-` character.\n\nThe code then uses the `get()` method to retrieve the price for the product from the `priceList` map, based on the name of the product (which is stored in the second part of the `orderData` array). The price is then multiplied by the quantity specified in the input string (which is stored in the first part of the `orderData` array), and the result is stored in the variable `orderPrice`.\n\nNote that the `get()` method returns an integer value, which is why the code uses the `Integer.parseInt()` method to convert the price string into an integer before multiplying it with the quantity.",
