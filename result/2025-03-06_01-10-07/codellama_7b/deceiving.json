It has its own protected field `_priorityPlan`, which represents the priority plan for the order.

In this case, the `PriorityOrder` class is a valid substitute for the `Order` class because it has all the same methods and fields as the base class, but it provides additional functionality by allowing the user to specify a priority plan for the order.\n\nThe use of delegation in the `PriorityOrder` class allows the subclass to reuse the implementation of the `getDaysToShip()` method from the base class, while still providing its own custom behavior.
