The `setDimension` method does not have any side effects, meaning that it does not modify any other fields or variables in the object.\n4. The `setDimension` method is a mutator method, which means that it modifies the state of the object. In this case, it sets the `height` field to a new value.\n5.

The `setDimension` method is named \"setDimension\", which follows the standard naming convention for mutator methods in Java.\n8. The `setDimension` method takes two arguments: `name` and `value`, which are both of type `String`. This allows the method to be used with any string value as the name argument, and any double value as the value argument.\n9.

It then creates an instance of the appropriate subclass and returns it.\n\nHere are some examples of how you can use this method:\n```\n// Create a manager\nEmployee manager = EmployeeFactory.createEmployee(\"John Doe\", \"Manager\");\n\n// Create a salesperson\nEmployee salesperson = EmployeeFactory.createEmployee(\"Jane Smith\", \"Salesperson\");\n\n// Create a developer\nEmployee developer = EmployeeFactory.createEmployee(\"Bob Johnson\", \"Developer\");\n```\nThis code creates three different types of employees using the `createEmployee` method, each with a different type and name.",

It uses the `stream()` method to iterate over the list of invoices, and the `mapToDouble()` method to convert each invoice's amount to a double value. The `sum()` method is then used to calculate the total amount.\n\nThe `sendBill()` method sends the bill to the customer. It can be implemented in any way that makes sense for your specific use case, such as sending an email or making an API call to a third-party service.",

This will give us an array with two elements: the name of the product and the price of the product.\n\nWe then use the `priceList` map to get the price of the product based on its name, and multiply it by the quantity ordered (which is stored in the second element of the `orderData` array). Finally, we convert the result to an integer using the `Integer.parseInt()` method.\n\nNote that we use the `\\\\s+` regular expression to split the string into an array of strings based on one or more whitespace characters.
