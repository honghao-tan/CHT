However, in this case, the `PriorityOrder` class introduces a new field `_priorityPlan` that refers to a priority plan, and it overrides the `getDaysToShip()` method to return the number of days it takes for the order to be shipped from the warehouse according to the priority plan.\n\nThe LSP states that if S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T in a program may be replaced with objects of type S without altering any of the desirable properties of that program. In this case, the `PriorityOrder` class is a subtype of `Order`, and it can be used anywhere an `Order` object is expected, because it has all the same properties and methods as an `Order` object. However, the `PriorityOrder` class introduces a new field that is not present in the parent class, which means that it may have different behavior or additional functionality compared to an `Order` object. Therefore, the LSP requires that any changes made to the `PriorityOrder` class must be backwards compatible with existing code that uses `Order` objects. In other words, if a method is defined in the parent class that returns the number of days it takes for an order to be shipped from the warehouse, then the same method must return the same value when called on a `PriorityOrder` object as it would when called on an `Order` object.",
