The method is marked as `public`, which means it can be accessed from outside the class.\n* `if (name.equals(\"height\")) {` checks if the value of the `name` argument is equal to \"height\".

In this case, the `PriorityOrder` class is a subtype of `Order`, and it can be used anywhere an `Order` object is expected, because it has all the same properties and methods as an `Order` object. However, the `PriorityOrder` class introduces a new field that is not present in the parent class, which means that it may have different behavior or additional functionality compared to an `Order` object. Therefore, the LSP requires that any changes made to the `PriorityOrder` class must be backwards compatible with existing code that uses `Order` objects. In other words, if a method is defined in the parent class that returns the number of days it takes for an order to be shipped from the warehouse, then the same method must return the same value when called on a `PriorityOrder` object as it would when called on an `Order` object.",

In this case, the first element in the array is the entire input string, and the second element is the substring that occurs after the first occurrence of the `-` character.\n\nThe code then uses the `get()` method to retrieve the price for the product from the `priceList` map, based on the name of the product (which is stored in the second part of the `productDetails` array). The price is then multiplied by the quantity specified in the input string (which is stored in the first part of the `orderData` array), and the result is stored in the variable `orderPrice`.\n\nNote that the `get()` method returns an integer value, which is then converted to a string using the `toString()` method. This is necessary because the `priceList` map contains integer values, but the input string may contain non-integer values (e.g., \"10.50\").",
