The method returns the total cost of the item based on the quantity and price of the item.\n\nThe method first calculates the base price of the item by multiplying the quantity and price of the item. Then, it checks if the base price is greater than 1000. If it is, the method returns the base price multiplied by 0.95 (95% discount). Otherwise, it returns the base price multiplied by 0.98 (98% discount).\n\nBy using a query method like `massAtrocity`, we can make our code more readable and easier to understand. The method name clearly communicates what the method does, and the code is more concise and efficient.",

This allows us to create instances of the `MassAtrocityEmployee` class and use its specific methods.\n\nAlso, we have updated the `createEmployee` method to return an instance of the `Employee` class by default, which means that if the `type` parameter is not set to \"massAtrocity\", it will create an instance of the `Employee` class.",
