It then creates an instance of the appropriate subclass and returns it.\n\nHere are some examples of how you can use this method:\n```\n// Create a manager\nEmployee manager = EmployeeFactory.createEmployee(\"John Doe\", \"Manager\");\n\n// Create a salesperson\nEmployee salesperson = EmployeeFactory.createEmployee(\"Jane Smith\", \"Salesperson\");\n\n// Create an engineer\nEmployee engineer = EmployeeFactory.createEmployee(\"Bob Johnson\", \"Engineer\");\n```\nThis code creates three different types of employees using the `createEmployee` method, each with a different type and name.",

The `\\\\s+` pattern matches one or more whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, line breaks, etc.).\n2. `orderData[0].split(\"–\")` splits the first element of the `orderData` array into an array of substrings using the `-` character as the delimiter. This will give us the product name and price in separate elements of the array.\n3. `priceList.get(productDetails[1])` retrieves the price for the product from the `priceList` map using the product name as the key. The `productDetails[1]` element contains the product name, which we use to look up its price in the map.\n4. `Integer.parseInt(orderData[1])` parses the order quantity as an integer.\n5. `* productPrice` calculates the total cost of the order by multiplying the order quantity by the product price.\n\nNote that this code assumes that the input string is in the format \"product name – product price\", where the product name and price are separated by a hyphen (-). If the input string has a different format, you may need to modify the code accordingly.",
