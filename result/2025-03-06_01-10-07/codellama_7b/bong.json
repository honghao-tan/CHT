This field is used to store information about the priority plan for the order.\n\nThe `getDaysToShip()` method in the `PriorityOrder` class overrides the method with the same name in the `Order` class.

In this case, the `PriorityOrder` class extends the `Order` class, which means it inherits all of its properties and methods. However, the `PriorityOrder` class also adds its own field and method to provide additional functionality for priority orders.\n\nIt's worth noting that in Java, you can only inherit from one superclass, but you can implement multiple interfaces.

The `push` method adds an element to the end of the list, and the `pop` method removes the last element from the list. The `isEmpty` method returns true if the list is empty.\n\nTo use a delegate instead of a superclass, you can create a separate class that implements the desired behavior and then have the `Stack` class use an instance of this class as its delegate. Here's an example of how you could do this:\n```\nclass Bong {\n    private final List<Integer> list;\n\n    public Bong() {\n        this.list = new ArrayList<>();\n    }\n\n    public void push(int value) {\n        list.add(value);\n    }\n\n    public int pop() {\n        return list.remove(list.size() - 1);\n    }\n\n    public boolean isEmpty() {\n        return list.isEmpty();\n    }\n}\n\nclass Stack {\n    private final Bong bong;\n\n    public Stack() {\n        this.bong = new Bong();\n    }\n\n    public void push(int value) {\n        bong.push(value);\n    }\n\n    public int pop() {\n        return bong.pop();\n    }\n\n    public boolean isEmpty() {\n        return bong.isEmpty();\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this example, the `Bong` class has the same behavior as the previous `List` class, but it is now a separate class that can be used as a delegate for the `Stack` class. The `Stack` class has a private field of type `Bong` called `bong`, and it uses this field to implement the desired behavior.\n\nUsing a delegate instead of a superclass can make your code more flexible and modular, because you can change the behavior of the `Stack` class without having to modify its source code.

The resulting strings are then used to retrieve the price and name of the product from the `priceList` map.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of what the code does:\n\n1. `String[] orderData = orderString.split(\"\\\\s+\");`: This line splits the input string into two parts based on one or more whitespace characters (`\\s+`). The resulting array contains two strings, where the first string is the product name and the second string is the quantity of the product.\n2. `String[] productDetails = orderData[0].split(\"–\");`: This line splits the first part of the input string (i.e., the product name) into two substrings based on the character `-`. The resulting array contains two strings, where the first string is the product name and the second string is the product price.\n3. `int productPrice = priceList.get(productDetails[1]);`: This line retrieves the price of the product from the `priceList` map using the product name as the key. The resulting integer value represents the price of the product.\n4. `int orderPrice = Integer.parseInt(orderData[1]) * productPrice;`: This line calculates the total cost of the order by multiplying the quantity of the product (represented as a string) with its corresponding price. The resulting integer value represents the total cost of the order.\n\nOverall, this code is used to parse an input string in the format \"product name – quantity\" and retrieve the corresponding price and calculate the total cost of the order based on the product's price and quantity.",

We store this value in a variable called `temp`. Then, we calculate the area of the rectangle again, but this time using the formula `height * width`. We store this value in a variable called `bong`.\n\nNote that it's generally a good practice to use meaningful and descriptive variable names. In this case, we could have named the variables `area` and `perimeter`, respectively, to make the code more readable.",
