This will make the code easier to read and understand.\n2. Use a consistent naming convention: In your code, you use both camelCase and PascalCase for your variable names. It's better to stick with one convention throughout the code. For example, you can use camelCase for all variable names.\n3. Avoid using `public` modifier unnecessarily: The `public` modifier is used to make a class or member accessible from outside the package. In this case, you don't need to make the constructor public since it's only being called within the same class. You can remove the `public` modifier from the constructor.\n4. Use a consistent indentation style: In your code, some lines have four spaces of indentation and others have eight. It's better to use a consistent indentation style throughout the code. For example, you can use four spaces for all indentation levels.\n5. Avoid using `if` statements unnecessarily: In your code, you use an `if` statement to check if the customer's name is \"unknown\". However, this can be simplified by using a ternary operator instead. For example:\n```\nreturn (name == null || name.equals(\"unknown\")) ? \"occupant\" : name;\n```\nThis code is more concise and easier to read than the `if` statement version.",

We then set its `numberOfCoconuts` field to 3. Finally, we call the `getPlumage()` method on the instance and it returns the appropriate type of plumage based on the value of the `type` field. In this case, the output is `\"tired\"`, which indicates that the African swallow is tired due to having too many coconuts.",

The `Order` class has a protected field `_warehouse` that refers to a warehouse, and it provides a method `getDaysToShip()` that returns the number of days it takes for the order to be shipped from the warehouse.\n\nThe `PriorityOrder` class is a subclass of `Order`, which means that it inherits all the properties and methods of the parent class. However, in this case, the `PriorityOrder` class introduces a new field `_priorityPlan` that refers to a priority plan, and it overrides the `getDaysToShip()` method to return the number of days it takes for the order to be shipped from the warehouse according to the priority plan.\n\nThe LSP states that if a parent class is substitutable for one of its subclasses, then all references to the parent class should be able to refer to the subclass without breaking any code that uses the parent class. In this case, the `PriorityOrder` class is substitutable for the `Order` class, but it introduces a new field and method that are not present in the parent class. Therefore, if we have a reference to an `Order` object, we should be able to use it as a `PriorityOrder` object without any issues.\n\nTo achieve this, we can use a delegate or a wrapper class to handle the additional functionality of the `PriorityOrder` class. The delegate or wrapper class would contain the original `Order` object and the new `PriorityPlan` object, and it would forward all method calls to the appropriate object based on the type of the reference. This way, we can use a reference to an `Order` object as if it were a `PriorityOrder` object without any issues.\n\nFor example:\n```\nclass PriorityOrderDelegate {\n    private Order _order;\n    private PriorityPlan _priorityPlan;\n\n    public PriorityOrderDelegate(Order order, PriorityPlan priorityPlan) {\n        _order = order;\n        _priorityPlan = priorityPlan;\n    }\n\n    public int getDaysToShip() {\n        if (_priorityPlan != null) {\n            return _priorityPlan.getDaysToShip();\n        } else {\n            return _order.getDaysToShip();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this example, we have created a delegate class `PriorityOrderDelegate` that contains an `Order` object and a `PriorityPlan` object. The `getDaysToShip()` method of the delegate class forwards all method calls to either the `Order` or `PriorityPlan` object based on the type of the reference. This way, we can use a reference to an `Order` object as if it were a `PriorityOrder` object without any issues.\n\nIn summary, using a delegate or wrapper class to handle additional functionality in a subclass is one way to achieve the LSP and avoid breaking existing code that uses the parent class.",
