The method checks if the given name is equal to \"height\". If it is, then it sets the `height` field to the given value.\n3. The method does not take any arguments other than the two mentioned above, so it cannot be called with a third argument (the flag).\n4. The method does not return anything, so it cannot be used in an expression that requires a result.\n5. The `setDimension` method is public, which means it can be accessed from outside the class. This allows other classes to set the height of this rectangle instance.\n6. The `height` field is private, which means it can only be accessed within the class where it was declared.

This will give us an array with two elements: the name of the product and the quantity ordered.\n\nNext, we split the first element of the `orderData` array (the name of the product) into another array using the regular expression `-`. This will give us an array with two elements: the name of the product and the price of the product.\n\nWe then use the `priceList` to get the price of the product based on its name, and multiply it by the quantity ordered (which is stored in the second element of the `orderData` array). This gives us the total cost of the order.\n\nNote that we use the `get()` method of the `HashMap` class to retrieve the value associated with a given key. In this case, we are using the name of the product as the key and the price of the product as the value.",
