We then split the first element of the array (which is the product name and price) into an array of strings using the `split()` method again, this time with a regular expression that matches a hyphen (`–`) followed by any number of digits.\n\nWe then use the `get()` method to retrieve the price for the product from the `priceList` map, based on the second element of the `productDetails` array (which is the product name). We then multiply the order quantity by the product price and store the result in the `orderPrice` variable.\n\nNote that we use the `Integer.parseInt()` method to convert the string representation of the order quantity into an integer, so that we can perform arithmetic operations on it.",
