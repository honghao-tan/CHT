The constants are defined as `public static final int` fields, which means they are immutable and can be accessed from anywhere in the code without needing an instance of the class.\n\nBy extracting this enum, we can make the code more readable and easier to maintain by separating the different types of alignment into a separate class. This also allows us to use the enum in other parts of the code where it is needed, such as when setting the alignment of a text field or when creating a layout manager that supports multiple alignments.\n\nOverall, extracting a class as an enum can be a useful technique for organizing and reusing code in Java. It allows us to define a set of related constants in a separate class, which can make the code more readable and easier to maintain.",

The `getManager()` and `setManager()` methods are the same as in the original `Department` class, but the `getSlandererName()` and `setSlandererName()` methods are new and allow you to get and set the name of the slanderer.\n\nYou can then use the `Slanderer` class instead of the `Department` class in your code, like this:\n```\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Slanderer department = new Slanderer(\"John Doe\", \"Jane Smith\");\n        System.out.println(department.getManager()); // Output: John Doe\n        System.out.println(department.getSlandererName()); // Output: Jane Smith\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this example, the `Main` class creates a new instance of the `Slanderer` class and sets the manager's name to \"John Doe\" and the slanderer's name to \"Jane Smith\".

This method is called when the `getDaysToShip()` method is invoked on an instance of the `PriorityOrder` class, and it delegates the call to the `getDaysToShip()` method of the `_priorityPlan` field.\n\nBy using a delegate in this way, we can avoid having to duplicate code for each subclass of `Order`.
