This allows you to pass in any percentage value that you want to use for the raise. For example:\n```\nPerson person = new Person();\nperson.setSalary(new BigDecimal(\"10000\"));\nperson.tenPercentRaise(BigDecimal.valueOf(1.1));\nSystem.out.println(person.getSalary()); // Output: 11000\n```\nIn this example, the `tenPercentRaise` function is called with a `percentage` value of `1.1`, which means that the salary will be increased by 10%. The output of the `getSalary` method is then printed to the console, showing that the salary has been increased by 10% as expected.\n\nYou can also use this approach to parameterize other functions in your class, such as a `raiseByPercentage` function that takes a `percentage` parameter and raises the salary by that percentage:\n```\npublic void raiseByPercentage(BigDecimal percentage) {\n    this.salary = this.salary.multiply(percentage);\n}\n```\nThis allows you to call the `raiseByPercentage` function with any percentage value that you want, and it will raise the salary by that percentage. For example:\n```\nPerson person = new Person();\nperson.setSalary(new BigDecimal(\"10000\"));\nperson.raiseByPercentage(BigDecimal.valueOf(0.1));\nSystem.out.println(person.getSalary()); // Output: 1100\n```\nIn this example, the `raiseByPercentage` function is called with a `percentage` value of `0.1`, which means that the salary will be increased by 10%.

This field is used to store information about the priority plan for the order.\n\nThe `getDaysToShip()` method in the `PriorityOrder` class overrides the method with the same name in the `Order` class.

Use meaningful variable names: Instead of using `temp` as a variable name, you can use more descriptive names like `area` or `perimeter`. This will make your code easier to read and understand.\n2. Use consistent formatting: You should use the same formatting throughout your code. For example, you can use spaces instead of tabs to indent your code.\n3. Avoid unnecessary variables: In this case, you don't need to create a separate variable for `height * width`. Instead, you can directly print the result of the multiplication operation.\n\nHere's an improved version of the code:\n```\nint area = 2 * (height + width);\nSystem.out.println(area);\n\nSystem.out.println(height * width);\n```",
