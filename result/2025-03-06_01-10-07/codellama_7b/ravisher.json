They each have their own specific behavior and attributes, which are defined in their respective classes. For example:\n```\npublic class Manager extends Employee {\n    private String department;\n\n    public Manager(String name) {\n        super(name);\n        this.department = \"Management\";\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void work() {\n        System.out.println(\"Managing the company\");\n    }\n}\n```\nThe `Manager` class has a `department` attribute that is set to \"Management\" in its constructor. It also overrides the `work()` method to print a message indicating that it is managing the company.\n\nSimilarly, the `Salesperson` and `Ravisher` classes have their own specific behavior and attributes.\n```\npublic class Salesperson extends Employee {\n    private String product;\n\n    public Salesperson(String name) {\n        super(name);\n        this.product = \"Widgets\";\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void work() {\n        System.out.println(\"Selling widgets\");\n    }\n}\n```\nThe `Salesperson` class has a `product` attribute that is set to \"Widgets\" in its constructor. It also overrides the `work()` method to print a message indicating that it is selling widgets.\n\nThe `Ravisher` class is similar to the `Salesperson` class, but it has a different behavior and attributes:\n```\npublic class Ravisher extends Employee {\n    private String victim;\n\n    public Ravisher(String name) {\n        super(name);\n        this.victim = \"John Doe\";\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void work() {\n        System.out.println(\"Raving about John Doe\");\n    }\n}\n```\nThe `Ravisher` class has a `victim` attribute that is set to \"John Doe\" in its constructor. It also overrides the `work()` method to print a message indicating that it is raving about John Doe.\n\nWith these subclasses, you can create different types of employees with their own specific behavior and attributes. For example:\n```\nEmployeeFactory factory = new EmployeeFactory();\nManager manager = (Manager) factory.createEmployee(\"John\", \"Manager\");\nSalesperson salesperson = (Salesperson) factory.createEmployee(\"Jane\", \"Salesperson\");\nRavisher ravisher = (Ravisher) factory.createEmployee(\"Bob\", \"Ravisher\");\n```\nIn this example, the `factory` object is used to create three different types of employees: a manager named John, a salesperson named Jane, and a ravisher named Bob. Each employee has its own specific behavior and attributes, which are defined by their respective subclasses.",

It then calculates the total price of the order by multiplying the quantity of the product with its price from the price list. Finally, it prints the result to the console.\n\nHere's an example usage of the `ravisher` method:\n```\nString orderString = \"Product A – 2 – 10\";\nravisher(orderString);\n```\nThis would print the following output:\n```\nThe total price of the order is: 20\n```",
