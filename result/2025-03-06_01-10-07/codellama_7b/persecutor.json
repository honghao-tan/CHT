The `push` method adds an element to the end of the list, and the `pop` method removes the last element from the list. The `isEmpty` method returns true if the list is empty.\n\nTo use a delegate instead of a superclass, you can create a separate class that implements the same interface as the superclass. For example:\n```\ninterface StackDelegate {\n    void push(int value);\n    int pop();\n    boolean isEmpty();\n}\n\nclass DelegateStack implements StackDelegate {\n    private final List<Integer> list;\n\n    public DelegateStack() {\n        this.list = new ArrayList<>();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void push(int value) {\n        list.add(value);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public int pop() {\n        return list.remove(list.size() - 1);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public boolean isEmpty() {\n        return list.isEmpty();\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this example, the `DelegateStack` class implements the same interface as the `Stack` class, but it uses a separate implementation of the methods. The `push`, `pop`, and `isEmpty` methods are all implemented in the `DelegateStack` class, while the `List<Integer>` field is defined in the `DelegateStack` class.\n\nTo use the delegate instead of the superclass, you can create an instance of the `DelegateStack` class and pass it to a method that expects a `StackDelegate` parameter:\n```\npublic void doSomethingWithStack(StackDelegate stack) {\n    // ...\n}\n\n// ...\n\nDelegateStack myStack = new DelegateStack();\ndoSomethingWithStack(myStack);\n```\nIn this example, the `doSomethingWithStack` method expects a `StackDelegate` parameter, and it is called with an instance of the `DelegateStack` class. The `DelegateStack` class implements the same interface as the `Stack` class, so it can be used in place of the `Stack` class.",

We then store the resulting array of strings in the variable `orderData`.\n\nNext, we split the first element of the `orderData` array (which is the product name and price) into two parts using the `split()` method with a regular expression that matches a hyphen (`–`) character. We store the resulting array of strings in the variable `productDetails`.\n\nFinally, we use the `get()` method of the `priceList` map to retrieve the price for the product name stored in the second element of the `productDetails` array. We then multiply this price by the quantity (stored in the first element of the `orderData` array) and store the result in the variable `orderPrice`.\n\nNote that we use the `Integer.parseInt()` method to convert the string representation of the quantity into an integer value, which is necessary because the `get()` method returns a `String` object representing the price for the product name.",
