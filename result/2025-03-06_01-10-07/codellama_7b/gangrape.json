The `record` keyword is used to define the record, followed by the name of the record and its parameters enclosed in parentheses.\n\nIn this example, we have defined a record called `R` with a single parameter `i`. The constructor for the record is defined using the curly braces `{}`, which are placed after the closing parenthesis of the parameter list. Inside the constructor, we have used the `System.out.println()` method to print a message to the console.\n\nThe `@SuppressWarnings(\"preview\")` annotation is used to suppress warnings about the use of preview features in this code. The `record` feature is currently in preview and may change before it becomes available in stable releases of Java.\n\nThis record can be used like any other class, with its constructor being called when an instance of the record is created. For example:\n```\nR r = new R(10);\nSystem.out.println(r.i); // prints 10\n```\nNote that records are immutable by default, which means that once an instance of a record is created, its state cannot be changed. If you need to modify the state of a record, you can use a mutable variant of the record using the `record` keyword with the `mutable` modifier. For example:\n```\n@SuppressWarnings(\"preview\")\nrecord R(int i) {\n\tR {\n\t\tSystem.out.println(\"Compact Constructor\");\n\t}\n\tvoid setI(int newValue) {\n\t\ti = newValue;\n\t}\n}\n```\nIn this example, we have defined a mutable variant of the `R` record called `RMutable`. The constructor for the record is still defined using the curly braces `{}`, but now it also includes a method named `setI()` that can be used to modify the value of the `i` field.\n\nNote that the `@SuppressWarnings(\"preview\")` annotation is still used to suppress warnings about the use of preview features in this code, even though we are using a mutable record.",

The second line of code assigns the value `height * width` to the variable `temp`.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of what each line of code does:\n\n1. `int temp = 2 * (height + width);` - This line declares a new integer variable named `temp` and initializes it with the value `2 * (height + width)`. The `*` operator is used to perform multiplication, and the `+` operator is used to perform addition.\n2. `System.out.println(temp);` - This line prints the value of the `temp` variable to the console using the `println()` method of the `System.out` object.\n3. `temp = height * width;` - This line assigns the value `height * width` to the `temp` variable. The `*` operator is used to perform multiplication, and the `=` operator is used to assign a new value to the variable.\n4. `System.out.println(temp);` - This line prints the value of the `temp` variable to the console using the `println()` method of the `System.out` object.\n\nIn summary, the first line of code declares and initializes a new integer variable named `temp`, while the second line of code assigns a new value to the `temp` variable. The third and fourth lines of code print the values of the `temp` variable to the console using the `println()` method of the `System.out` object.",
