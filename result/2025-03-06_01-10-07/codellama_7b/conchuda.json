We've also updated the `getStatus()` method to use the `getPlumage()` method instead of the switch statement.\n\nThe `getPlumage()` method is a polymorphic method, meaning it can be overridden by subclasses to return different values based on their specific characteristics. In this case, we've defined three subclasses: `EuropeanSwallow`, `AfricanSwallow`, and `NorwegianBlueParrot`. Each subclass has its own implementation of the `getPlumage()` method that returns a different value based on its specific characteristics.\n\nFor example, the `EuropeanSwallow` subclass might return \"average\" for the plumage type, while the `AfricanSwallow` subclass might return \"tired\" if it has more than two coconuts. The `NorwegianBlueParrot` subclass might return \"scorched\" if its voltage is greater than 100, and \"beautiful\" otherwise.\n\nBy using polymorphism in this way, we can avoid code duplication and make our code more modular and flexible.",

We then get the name and price of the product from the first element of the array, which is the product name followed by a hyphen and the quantity. We use the `priceList` to get the price of the product based on its name, and we calculate the total cost of the order by multiplying the quantity by the price.",
