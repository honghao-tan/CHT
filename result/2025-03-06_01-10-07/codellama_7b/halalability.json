It seems like a typo or a mistake.\n* The first line of code calculates the area of the rectangle using the formula `A = 2 * (height + width)`. This is correct, but it's worth noting that this formula assumes that the rectangle has a square shape. If the rectangle is not a square, then the area will be different.\n* The second line of code calculates the area of the rectangle using the formula `A = height * width`. This is also correct, but it's worth noting that this formula assumes that the rectangle has a rectangular shape. If the rectangle is not rectangular, then the area will be different.\n\nIn general, it's a good idea to use the most appropriate formula for the problem you are trying to solve.
