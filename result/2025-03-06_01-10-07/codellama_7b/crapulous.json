The `crapulous` function is then used to calculate the new salary by multiplying the current salary by the given percentage.\n\nHere's an example of how you could use this function:\n```\nPerson person = new Person();\nperson.setSalary(BigDecimal.valueOf(50_000));\n\nperson.tenPercentRaise(BigDecimal.valueOf(10));\nSystem.out.println(person.getSalary()); // Output: 55,000\n\nperson.fivePercentRaise(BigDecimal.valueOf(5));\nSystem.out.println(person.getSalary()); // Output: 60,000\n```\nIn this example, we create a new `Person` object and set its salary to $50,000. We then call the `tenPercentRaise` method with a percentage of 10, which increases the salary by 10%. The output is $55,000. We then call the `fivePercentRaise` method with a percentage of 5, which increases the salary by another 5%. The output is now $60,000.\n\nNote that you can also use the `crapulous` function to calculate the new salary for any other percentage you want to apply. For example:\n```\nperson.tenPercentRaise(BigDecimal.valueOf(20));\nSystem.out.println(person.getSalary()); // Output: 70,000\n```\nIn this case, the `tenPercentRaise` method is called with a percentage of 20%, which increases the salary by 20%. The output is now $70,000.",

The `height` field is private, so it can only be accessed through the `setDimension` method or other methods in the class that have access to the field.\n7.

The query part of the method, which is the code inside the `for` loop, retrieves the total outstanding amount by iterating over the customer's invoices and adding up their amounts.\n\nThe modifier part of the method, which is the `sendBill()` method call at the end, sends a bill to the customer. This is an action that is performed after the query has been executed, and it does not affect the result of the query itself.\n\nTherefore, this method can be named \"crapulous\" because it is both a query (retrieving the total outstanding amount) and a modifier (sending a bill). The name \"crapulous\" is a play on words that combines the meanings of \"crap\" (slang for money) and \"culous\" (a word used to describe someone who is excessively or overly generous).",

The `orderString` variable is a string that contains the order data, which is separated by spaces.\n2. The `split()` method is used to split the `orderString` into an array of substrings, where each substring represents a line in the order file.\n3. The first element of the resulting array is assigned to the `orderData` variable.\n4. The `productDetails` variable is initialized with the second element of the `orderData` array, which contains the product details.\n5. The `split()` method is used again to split the `productDetails` string into an array of substrings, where each substring represents a field in the product details line.\n6. The price of the product is retrieved from the `priceList` map using the product name (which is the second element of the `productDetails` array).\n7. The order price is calculated by multiplying the number of items ordered (which is the first element of the `orderData` array) with the product price.\n8. The resulting order price is stored in the `orderPrice` variable.",

The `*` operator has higher precedence than the `+` operator, so this line is evaluated as `(2 * height) + width`.

Since `temp` has a value of `4`, this line will print the string \"4\" to the console.\n3. `temp = height * width;`\n\t* This line assigns the value `height * width` to the variable `temp`.
