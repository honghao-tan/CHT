The method does not have any return statement, so it returns `void`.\n4. The method is public, meaning that it can be called from outside the class.\n5. The method is named `setDimension`, which suggests that it sets a dimension of the rectangle.\n6. The method takes two arguments, `name` and `value`, which are both of type `String`. This makes sense because the method is intended to set the height of the rectangle.\n7. The method uses an `if` statement to check if the `name` argument is equal to `\"height\"`. If it is not, then the method does nothing. This means that the method can only be used to set the height of the rectangle, and cannot be used to set any other dimension.\n8.

The `+` symbol in the regular expression pattern matches one or more whitespace characters.\n* `productDetails = orderData[0].split(\"–\");` splits the first element of the `orderData` array (which is the product name and quantity) into an array of substrings using the `-` character as the delimiter. The `-` character is used to separate the product name from the quantity in the input string.\n* `productPrice = priceList.get(productDetails[1]);` retrieves the price for the product from the `priceList` map using the product name as the key.\n* `orderPrice = Integer.parseInt(orderData[1]) * productPrice;` calculates the total order price by multiplying the quantity in the input string with the product price. The `Integer.parseInt()` method is used to convert the quantity string into an integer, and then it is multiplied with the product price.\n\nNote that this code assumes that the input string contains a valid product name and quantity, and that the product name is followed by a `-` character and then the quantity. If the input string does not contain a valid product name or quantity, or if the product name is not followed by a `-` character, then the code will throw an exception.",

We then print the value of `temp` to the console. Next, we calculate the area of the rectangle again using the formula `height * width` and store the result in the same variable `temp`. Finally, we print the value of `temp` to the console again.\n\nNote that in Java, you can only use a single assignment operator (`=`) to assign a value to a variable.
