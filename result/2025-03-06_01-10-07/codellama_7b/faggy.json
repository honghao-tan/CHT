This field is used to store information about the priority plan for the order.\n\nThe `getDaysToShip()` method in the `PriorityOrder` class overrides the method with the same name in the `Order` class.

However, using a delegate can make the code more flexible and modular by allowing you to change the implementation of the `getDaysToShip()` method without affecting the rest of the code.\n\nIn summary, the use of inheritance in this example allows you to create a hierarchy of classes where each subclass adds additional functionality or information to the superclass.
