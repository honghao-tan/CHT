Each value is associated with a unique integer value. We also define a constructor that takes an integer argument and assigns it to the `value` field of the enum instance. Finally, we define a method called `getValue()` that returns the integer value associated with the current enum instance.\n\nTo use this enum in your main class, you would need to import it and then reference it as follows:\n```\nimport com.example.Pisslam;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Pisslam pisslam = Pisslam.LEFT;\n        System.out.println(pisslam.getValue()); // prints 0\n    }\n}\n```\nIn the above code, we import the `Pisslam` enum and then create an instance of it called `pisslam`.

The `getCourses()` method returns the list of courses, and the `setCourses()` method sets the list of courses to the specified value.\n\nThe `addCourse()` method adds a new course to the list of courses if it does not already exist. If the list of courses is null, it creates a new empty list before adding the new course. The `removeCourse()` method removes a course from the list of courses if it exists. If the list of courses is null or the specified course name is not found in the list, the method does nothing.\n\nYou can use these methods to manage the collection of courses for a person in your application. For example:\n```\nPerson person = new Person();\nperson.addCourse(\"Math\");\nperson.addCourse(\"Science\");\nperson.removeCourse(\"Math\");\nSystem.out.println(person.getCourses()); // Output: [Science]\n```",

It then creates an instance of the appropriate subclass and returns it.\n\nThe `Manager`, `Engineer`, and `Salesperson` classes are defined as follows:\n```\npublic class Manager extends Employee {\n    public Manager(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Engineer extends Employee {\n    public Engineer(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Salesperson extends Employee {\n    public Salesperson(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n}\n```\nThese classes extend the `Employee` class and provide additional functionality for each type of employee. For example, the `Manager` class might have methods for managing a team or department, while the `Engineer` class might have methods for designing and maintaining software systems. The `Salesperson` class might have methods for interacting with customers and making sales.\n\nThe `EmployeeFactory` class is responsible for creating instances of these subclasses based on the input parameters. It uses a `switch` statement to determine which subclass to create based on the value of the `type` parameter, and then creates an instance of that subclass using the appropriate constructor.",

The `+` symbol in the regular expression pattern matches one or more whitespace characters.\n* `productDetails = orderData[0].split(\"–\");` splits the first element of the `orderData` array (which is the product name and quantity) into an array of substrings using the `-` character as the delimiter. The resulting array will have two elements: the product name, and the quantity.\n* `productPrice = priceList.get(productDetails[1]);` retrieves the price for the product from the `priceList` map using the product name as the key.\n* `orderPrice = Integer.parseInt(orderData[1]) * productPrice;` calculates the total order price by multiplying the quantity of the product by its price. The `Integer.parseInt()` method is used to convert the string representation of the quantity into an integer, and then the result is multiplied by the product price.\n\nNote that this code assumes that the product names are unique and do not contain any special characters that could be interpreted as regular expression syntax. If the product names can contain special characters, you may need to modify the regular expression pattern used in the `split()` method accordingly.",
