This parameter represents the percentage of the salary that the employee wants to raise. The function then uses the `multiply` method of the `BigDecimal` class to multiply the current salary by the given percentage.\n\nYou can call this function in your code like this:\n```\nPerson person = new Person();\nperson.setSalary(new BigDecimal(\"10000\"));\nperson.homIntern(0.1); // raise salary by 10%\nSystem.out.println(person.getSalary()); // prints \"11000\"\n```\nThis code creates a new `Person` object and sets its initial salary to $10,000. It then calls the `homIntern` function with a parameter of 0.1 (which represents a 10% raise). Finally, it prints the updated salary using the `getSalary` method.",

The `setDimension` method can be called with any string as the first argument, and it will set the appropriate field based on the value of the `name` argument.\n5. The `height` field is private, so only methods within the class can access it. This ensures that the height of the rectangle cannot be modified outside of the class.\n6. The `setDimension` method is a setter method, which means it allows you to modify the state of an object after it has been created. In this case, it allows you to set the height of the rectangle.\n7.

In this case, the `PriorityOrder` class adds an additional field `_priorityPlan` that refers to an instance of the `PriorityPlan` class, and it overrides the `getDaysToShip()` method to use the value returned by the `getDaysToShip()` method of the `PriorityPlan` object.\n\nThis design pattern is called delegation because the subclass is \"delegating\" its implementation of the `getDaysToShip()` method to an instance of a different class, in this case the `PriorityPlan` class. This allows the subclass to provide a customized implementation of the method while still using the shared functionality provided by the parent class.\n\nIn general, delegation is a useful pattern for situations where you want to provide a default implementation of a method that can be overridden by subclasses as needed.

The `push` method adds an element to the end of the list, and the `pop` method removes the last element from the list. The `isEmpty` method returns true if the list is empty.\n\nThe `Stack` class also has a constructor that initializes the `list` field with a new instance of `ArrayList`. This allows the `Stack` class to be used as a stack, where elements are added and removed from the end of the list.\n\nBy using a delegate in this way, you can avoid having to define all of the methods for the `List` interface yourself, and instead use the existing implementation provided by the `ArrayList` class.

It then creates an instance of the appropriate subclass and returns it.\n\nYou can also use polymorphism to create a hierarchy of classes, where each subclass is a more specific version of the previous one. For example:\n```\npublic abstract class Employee {\n    // common fields and methods for all employees\n}\n\npublic class Manager extends Employee {\n    // fields and methods specific to managers\n}\n\npublic class Engineer extends Employee {\n    // fields and methods specific to engineers\n}\n\npublic class Salesperson extends Employee {\n    // fields and methods specific to salespeople\n}\n```\nIn this example, `Employee` is an abstract class that defines the common fields and methods for all employees. The other classes (`Manager`, `Engineer`, and `Salesperson`) are subclasses of `Employee` that define more specific versions of each employee type. This allows you to create instances of different types of employees without having to specify the exact type, as long as you have the appropriate constructor arguments.\n\nFor example:\n```\nManager manager = new Manager(\"John Doe\");\nEngineer engineer = new Engineer(\"Jane Smith\", \"Java\");\nSalesperson salesperson = new Salesperson(\"Bob Johnson\", \"Sales\", 100000);\n```\nIn this example, we create instances of the `Manager`, `Engineer`, and `Salesperson` classes using their constructors. The `Manager` class has a single constructor that takes a name as an argument, while the `Engineer` class has two constructors: one that takes a name and another that takes a name and a programming language. The `Salesperson` class has three constructors: one that takes a name, another that takes a name and a salary, and a third that takes a name, a department, and a salary.\n\nYou can also use interfaces to define a common set of methods that multiple classes can implement. For example:\n```\npublic interface Employee {\n    void work();\n}\n\npublic class Manager implements Employee {\n    @Override\n    public void work() {\n        // manager specific implementation\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Engineer implements Employee {\n    @Override\n    public void work() {\n        // engineer specific implementation\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Salesperson implements Employee {\n    @Override\n    public void work() {\n        // salesperson specific implementation\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this example, `Employee` is an interface that defines a single method called `work`. The `Manager`, `Engineer`, and `Salesperson` classes are all subclasses of `Employee` that implement the `work` method. This allows you to create instances of different types of employees without having to specify the exact type, as long as they implement the `work` method.\n\nFor example:\n```\nManager manager = new Manager();\nEngineer engineer = new Engineer();\nSalesperson salesperson = new Salesperson();\n\nmanager.work(); // calls the manager specific implementation of work()\nengineer.work(); // calls the engineer specific implementation of work()\nsalesperson.work(); // calls the salesperson specific implementation of work()\n```\nIn this example, we create instances of the `Manager`, `Engineer`, and `Salesperson` classes using their constructors. We then call the `work` method on each instance, which will call the appropriate implementation based on the type of employee.",

We then split the first element of the array (which is the order details) into another array of strings using the `split()` method with a regular expression that matches a hyphen (`–`) followed by any number of digits.\n\nWe then use the `get()` method to retrieve the price for the product from the `priceList` map, and multiply it by the quantity specified in the order details. Finally, we parse the second element of the `orderData` array as an integer using the `Integer.parseInt()` method and multiply it by the product price to get the total order price.\n\nNote that we use the `–` character instead of the `-` character in the regular expression for the `split()` method, because the `-` character is a special character in Java that represents a range of characters.",
