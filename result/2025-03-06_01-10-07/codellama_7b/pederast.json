The `name` field is now private, and can only be accessed through the `getName()` and `setName()` methods. Similarly, the `manager` field is also private, and can only be accessed through the `getManager()` and `setManager()` methods.\n\nBy using this approach, we can hide the delegation of the `Department` class's fields to the `DepartmentManager` class, which makes it easier to manage the access to these fields.",

The first way uses the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is `A = l * w`, where `l` is the length and `w` is the width. The second way uses the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is `P = 2 * (l + w)`, where `P` is the perimeter and `l` and `w` are the same as before.\n\nThe first line of code calculates the area using the formula for the area of a rectangle, and then prints it to the console. The second line of code calculates the perimeter using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, and then prints it to the console.\n\nIt's worth noting that the two formulas are related, but they are not exactly the same thing. The first formula gives you the area of the rectangle, while the second formula gives you the perimeter of the rectangle.",
