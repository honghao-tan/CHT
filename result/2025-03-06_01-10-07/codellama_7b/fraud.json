Use meaningful variable names: Instead of using `name` as the variable name for the customer's name, consider using something more descriptive like `customerName`. This will make the code easier to read and understand.\n2. Use a consistent naming convention: In this code, you have used both camelCase and PascalCase for your variable names. It's better to use one or the other consistently throughout the code. For example, you could use camelCase for all of your variable names.\n3. Avoid using `if` statements with a single condition: In this case, you have used an `if` statement with a single condition to check if the customer's name is \"unknown\". This can be simplified by using a ternary operator instead. For example:\n```\npublic String getName() {\n    return \"occupant\".equals(customerName) ? \"occupant\" : customerName;\n}\n```\nThis code is more concise and easier to read than the original `if` statement.\n4. Consider using a constant for the special case: Instead of hardcoding the string \"unknown\" in multiple places, consider defining it as a constant at the top of your class. This will make the code easier to maintain and understand.

The `setDimension` method takes two arguments: a `String` representing the name of the dimension (in this case, \"height\") and a `double` value for the dimension.\n2. The method checks if the given name is equal to \"height\". If it is, then it sets the `height` field to the given value.\n3. The method does not take any arguments related to the flag argument, so it is not necessary to include that in the method signature.\n4. The method is named `setDimension`, which is a common naming convention for methods that set or modify properties of an object.\n5. The method is public, which means that it can be accessed from outside the class. This allows other classes to use this method to set the height of a rectangle instance.\n6. The method does not have any side effects, meaning that it does not change any external state or have any observable effects on the program's behavior.\n7. The method is well-documented, with clear and concise comments explaining what it does and how to use it.\n\nOverall, this solution is a good way to handle the height of a rectangle while avoiding the flag argument.

In this case, the `PriorityOrder` class is a valid replacement for an `Order` object, because it provides the same behavior as an `Order` object in terms of the `getDaysToShip()` method.\n\nHowever, if we were to use a delegate instead of a subclass, we would lose some of the benefits of polymorphism.

The `getInvoices()` method is used to retrieve the list of invoices for the customer, and the `stream()` method is used to convert the list into a stream of invoice amounts. The `mapToDouble()` method is used to map each invoice amount to a double value, and the `sum()` method is used to calculate the total amount of outstanding invoices.",
