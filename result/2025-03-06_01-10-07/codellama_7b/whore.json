The `Order` class has a protected field `_warehouse` that refers to a warehouse, and it defines a method `getDaysToShip()` that returns the number of days it takes for the order to be shipped from the warehouse.\n\nThe `PriorityOrder` class is a subclass of `Order`, which means that it inherits all the properties and methods of the parent class. However, in this case, the `PriorityOrder` class introduces a new field `_priorityPlan` that refers to a priority plan, and it overrides the `getDaysToShip()` method to return the number of days it takes for the order to be shipped from the warehouse according to the priority plan.\n\nThe LSP states that if a parent class has a method that returns an object of a certain type, then any subclass that overrides this method must also return an object of the same type. In this case, the `PriorityOrder` class is returning an object of type `PriorityPlan`, which is not the same as the type returned by the parent class (`Warehouse`). This violates the LSP and can lead to unexpected behavior if a client code tries to use the `getDaysToShip()` method on a `PriorityOrder` instance.\n\nTo fix this issue, we could change the return type of the `getDaysToShip()` method in the `PriorityOrder` class to be the same as the parent class (`Warehouse`). This would ensure that the method returns an object of the same type as the one returned by the parent class.\n```\nclass PriorityOrder extends Order {\n    protected PriorityPlan _priorityPlan;\n\n    @Override\n    public Warehouse getDaysToShip() {\n        return _priorityPlan.getDaysToShip();\n    }\n}\n```",
