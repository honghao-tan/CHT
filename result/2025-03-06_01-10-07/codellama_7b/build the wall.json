It then creates an instance of the appropriate subclass and returns it.\n\nFor example, if you call `createEmployee(\"John Doe\", \"Manager\")`, it will return a new instance of the `Manager` class with the name \"John Doe\".\n\nYou can also use this approach to create instances of other subclasses, such as `Engineer` or `Salesperson`. Just replace the `switch` statement with the appropriate code for each subclass.",
