However, in this case, the `PriorityOrder` class introduces a new field `_priorityPlan` that refers to a priority plan, and it overrides the `getDaysToShip()` method to return the number of days it takes for the order to be shipped from the warehouse according to the priority plan.\n\nThe LSP states that if S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T in a program may be replaced with objects of type S without altering any of the desirable properties of that program. In this case, the `PriorityOrder` class is a subtype of `Order`, and it can be used anywhere an `Order` object is expected, because it provides all the same functionality as an `Order` object, but with an additional feature (the priority plan).\n\nThe use of a delegate in the `PriorityOrder` class allows us to decouple the implementation of the `getDaysToShip()` method from the `Order` class. Instead of implementing the method directly in the `Order` class, we can define it as a delegate that refers to an instance of a `PriorityPlan` object. This allows us to change the implementation of the method at runtime by simply changing the reference to the `PriorityPlan` object.\n\nIn summary, the use of a delegate in this example is a way to decouple the implementation of the `getDaysToShip()` method from the `Order` class, and it allows us to change the implementation at runtime without affecting the rest of the program.",

In this case, the first element in the array is the entire input string, and the second element is the substring that occurs after the first occurrence of the `-` character.\n\nThe code then uses the `get()` method to retrieve the price for the product from the `priceList` map, based on the name of the product (which is stored in the second part of the `productDetails` array). The price is then multiplied by the quantity specified in the input string (which is stored in the first part of the `orderData` array), and the result is stored in the variable `orderPrice`.\n\nNote that the code assumes that the input string will always be in the format \"product name - quantity\", where the product name is followed by a space and then the quantity.
