To fix this, you can make the field public or provide a getter method for it.\n2. The `PriorityOrder` class extends the `Order` class, but it does not override the `getDaysToShip()` method. This means that the `PriorityOrder` class will use the implementation of `getDaysToShip()` from the `Order` class, which is not what you want.

The `sendBill()` method is a modifier that sends a bill to the customer.\n\nThe `getTotalOutstandingAndSendBill()` method is a combination of both the query and modifier methods. It first retrieves the total amount of outstanding invoices for the customer using the `getTotalOutstanding()` method, and then sends a bill to the customer using the `sendBill()` method.

The price of the product is retrieved from the map using the product name, and then the total cost of the order is calculated by multiplying the product price by the quantity.
