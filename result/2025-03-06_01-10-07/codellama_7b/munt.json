The `getName()` method in the `Munt` class returns the name of the Munt if the name of the customer is \"unknown\", otherwise it returns the name of the customer.\n\nYou can use the `Munt` class like this:\n```\nCustomer c = new Customer(\"John Doe\");\nSystem.out.println(c.getName()); // Output: John Doe\n\nMunt m = new Munt(\"unknown\", \"Jane Smith\");\nSystem.out.println(m.getName()); // Output: Jane Smith\n```",

In this case, the `PriorityOrder` class is a subtype of `Order`, and it can be used anywhere an `Order` object is expected, without changing any of the desired properties of the program.\n\nThe use of delegation in the `PriorityOrder` class allows for more flexibility in the design of the system. Instead of having to modify the `Order` class to include a new field and method for handling priority orders, we can simply create a new subclass that inherits from `Order` and overrides the `getDaysToShip()` method to handle priority orders specifically.

It then creates an instance of the appropriate subclass and returns it.\n\nThe `Manager`, `Salesperson`, and `Developer` classes are subclasses of the `Employee` class, which means they inherit all of its properties and methods. Each subclass has its own specific behavior and implementation, but they all share the same basic structure and functionality.\n\nFor example, the `Manager` subclass might have additional methods for managing a team or department, while the `Salesperson` subclass might have methods for tracking sales figures or interacting with customers. The `Developer` subclass might have methods for writing code or debugging issues.\n\nBy using subclasses in this way, we can create a more flexible and modular system that allows us to add new types of employees without having to modify the existing code.",
