Here's an updated version of the `Customer` class that includes some additional features:\n\npublic class Customer {\n    private String name;\n\n    public Customer(String name) {\n        this.name = name;\n    }\n\n    public String getName() {\n        if (\"unknown\".equals(name)) {\n            return \"occupant\";\n        }\n        return name;\n    }\n}\n\nHere are some of the changes I made:\n\n1. I added a constructor to the `Customer` class that takes a single argument, which is the customer's name. This makes it easier for you to create new instances of the `Customer` class and set their names at the same time.\n2. I changed the `getName()` method to return the customer's name if it is not \"unknown\". If the name is \"unknown\", I return a string that says \"occupant\" instead. This makes it easier for you to handle the special case of an unknown customer.\n3. I added some additional whitespace and formatting to make the code more readable. This can help make your code easier to understand and maintain in the long run.\n\nOverall, this updated version of the `Customer` class is a bit more robust and easier to read than the original version. It includes some additional features that can help you handle the special case of an unknown customer more effectively.",

In this case, it is used to compare the priority of each order with the strings \"high\" and \"rush\".\n\nHere's an example of how you could use the `IdentityMisrepresentation` class:\n```\nList<Order> orders = ...; // a list of orders\n\n// filter the orders based on their priority\nList<Order> filteredOrders = orders.stream()\n    .filter(o -> \"high\".equals(o.getPriority()) || \"rush\".equals(o.getPriority()))\n    .collect(Collectors.toList());\n```\nIn this example, the `filter` method is used to create a new stream that contains only the orders with a certain priority.

In this case, the `PriorityOrder` class adds an additional field `_priorityPlan` that represents the priority plan for the order, and it overrides the `getDaysToShip()` method to use the priority plan instead of the warehouse's shipping time.\n\nThe LSP states that a subclass must be substitutable for its parent class, meaning that it should behave in the same way as the parent class. In this case, the `PriorityOrder` class is not substitutable for an `Order` object because it has additional properties and methods that are specific to priority orders.\n\nTo fix the issue, you could remove the `_priorityPlan` field from the `PriorityOrder` class and use a delegate instead. A delegate is an object that acts as an intermediary between two objects and forwards requests to one of them. In this case, you could create a delegate that represents the priority plan and forwards requests to it when the `getDaysToShip()` method is called.\n\nHere's an example of how you could implement the delegate:\n```\nclass PriorityPlanDelegate {\n    private PriorityPlan _priorityPlan;\n\n    public int getDaysToShip() {\n        return _priorityPlan.getDaysToShip();\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this example, the `PriorityPlanDelegate` class has a field `_priorityPlan` that represents the priority plan for the order, and it provides an implementation of the `getDaysToShip()` method that forwards requests to the priority plan.\n\nYou could then use the delegate in place of the `PriorityOrder` class:\n```\nclass Order {\n    protected Warehouse _warehouse;\n    protected PriorityPlanDelegate _priorityPlanDelegate;\n\n    public int getDaysToShip() {\n        return _warehouse.getDaysToShip();\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this example, the `Order` class has a field `_priorityPlanDelegate` that represents the delegate for the priority plan, and it provides an implementation of the `getDaysToShip()` method that forwards requests to the delegate when the method is called.

We've also defined a private method named `identityMisrepresentation` that takes a double parameter and returns the same value without any modifications.\n\nThe `getDiscountedPrice` method first calculates the base price of the item by multiplying the quantity and item price, and then calls the `identityMisrepresentation` method to apply the discount based on the base price. The `identityMisrepresentation` method checks if the base price is greater than 1000, and if so, returns the base price multiplied by 0.95. Otherwise, it returns the base price multiplied by 0.98.\n\nBy using a query method like this, we can separate the logic of calculating the discounted price from the logic of applying the discount, making our code more modular and easier to maintain.",

The `EmployeeType` enum contains three values: `MANAGER`, `ENGINEER`, and `SALESMAN`. The method uses a `switch` statement to determine which subclass of `Employee` to create based on the value of the `type` parameter.\n\nYou can then use this method like this:\n```\nEmployee employee = createEmployee(\"John Doe\", EmployeeType.MANAGER);\n```\nThis will create an instance of the `Manager` class and set its name to \"John Doe\".\n\nNote that you will need to define the `Manager`, `Engineer`, and `Salesman` classes as subclasses of `Employee`. You can do this by adding the following code to your program:\n```\npublic class Manager extends Employee {\n    // ...\n}\n\npublic class Engineer extends Employee {\n    // ...\n}\n\npublic class Salesman extends Employee {\n    // ...\n}\n```\nThis will create three subclasses of `Employee` that can be used to represent different types of employees. You can then use these subclasses to create instances of the appropriate subclass based on the value of the `type` parameter in the `createEmployee` method.",
