The `KerbCrawling` class has its own constructor and method for getting the customer's name. In this case, if the customer's name is \"unknown\", the method returns \"occupant\" instead of \"unknown\".\n\nWe can then use the `KerbCrawling` class to create instances of customers with special names, like so:\n```\nCustomer c1 = new Customer(\"John Doe\");\nCustomer c2 = new KerbCrawling(\"Jane Smith\");\n\nSystem.out.println(c1.getName()); // Output: John Doe\nSystem.out.println(c2.getName()); // Output: occupant\n```\nIn this example, we create two instances of the `Customer` class and one instance of the `KerbCrawling` class. We then print out the names of each customer using their respective `getName()` methods. The first customer has a normal name, so it prints \"John Doe\". The second customer has a special name, so it prints \"occupant\" instead of \"unknown\".",

We've also changed the way we read the order data from the user. Instead of using a `String` variable to store the entire order string, we're now using a `Scanner` object to read the input line by line. This allows us to easily split the input into an array of strings using the `split()` method.\n\nWe've also added some error handling to make sure that the user enters a valid product name and quantity. If the user enters an invalid product name or quantity, we print an error message and exit the program.\n\nOverall, this code is more efficient and easier to read than the previous version.",
