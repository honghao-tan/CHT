In this case, it's indicating that the `read()` method is being overridden from the `FilterReader` class.\n* `public int read(char[] cbuf, int off, int len) throws IOException {` - This line declares the `read()` method, which is a required method in the `FilterReader` interface. It takes three arguments: an array of characters (`cbuf`), an offset (`off`), and a length (`len`). The method returns an integer representing the number of characters read from the input stream.\n* `return super.read(cbuf, off, len);` - This line calls the `read()` method of the superclass (i.e., the `FilterReader` class) with the same arguments as the current method.

This way, the client code will only see the methods of the new class and not have access to the `Department` class directly. Here is an example of how you could do this:\n```\npublic class DepartmentWrapper {\n    private Department department;\n\n    public DepartmentWrapper(String manager) {\n        this.department = new Department(manager);\n    }\n\n    public String getManager() {\n        return department.getManager();\n    }\n\n    public void setManager(String manager) {\n        department.setManager(manager);\n    }\n}\n```\nNow, the client code can only access the `DepartmentWrapper` class and not the `Department` class directly.
