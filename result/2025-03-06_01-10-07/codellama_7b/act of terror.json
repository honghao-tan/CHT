The method is marked as `public`, which means it can be accessed from outside the class.\n* `if (name.equals(\"height\")) {` checks if the value of the `name` argument is equal to \"height\". If it is, then the code inside the `if` block will be executed.\n* `this.height = value;` sets the value of the `height` field to the value of the `value` argument.\n\nBy creating a method like this, you can set the height of the rectangle without having to pass it as an argument every time. You can simply call the `setDimension` method with the name \"height\" and the desired value for the height, and the method will take care of setting the correct value in the `height` field.",

The `push` method adds an element to the end of the list, and the `pop` method removes the last element from the list. The `isEmpty` method returns true if the list is empty.\n\nTo use a delegate instead of a superclass, you can create a separate class that implements the desired behavior and then have the `Stack` class use an instance of this class as its delegate. Here's an example of how you could do this:\n```\ninterface StackDelegate {\n    void push(int value);\n    int pop();\n    boolean isEmpty();\n}\n\nclass ListStack implements StackDelegate {\n    private final List<Integer> list;\n\n    public ListStack() {\n        this.list = new ArrayList<>();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void push(int value) {\n        list.add(value);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public int pop() {\n        return list.remove(list.size() - 1);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public boolean isEmpty() {\n        return list.isEmpty();\n    }\n}\n\nclass Stack {\n    private final ListStack delegate;\n\n    public Stack() {\n        this.delegate = new ListStack();\n    }\n\n    public void push(int value) {\n        delegate.push(value);\n    }\n\n    public int pop() {\n        return delegate.pop();\n    }\n\n    public boolean isEmpty() {\n        return delegate.isEmpty();\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this example, the `Stack` class has a private field of type `ListStack` called `delegate`. The `push` method calls the `push` method on the `delegate`, and the `pop` method calls the `pop` method on the `delegate`. The `isEmpty` method calls the `isEmpty` method on the `delegate`.\n\nBy using a delegate instead of a superclass, you can decouple the `Stack` class from the specific implementation of the stack data structure. This makes it easier to change the underlying implementation of the stack without affecting the rest of the code that uses the `Stack` class.",

        "content": "\nHere is the updated code with subclasses for the different types of employees:\n```\npublic class EmployeeFactory {\n    public static Employee createEmployee(String name, String type) {\n        switch (type) {\n            case \"actOfTerror\":\n                return new ActOfTerrorEmployee(name);\n            case \"scientist\":\n                return new ScientistEmployee(name);\n            case \"manager\":\n                return new ManagerEmployee(name);\n            default:\n                throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Invalid employee type\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this updated code, we have added subclasses for the different types of employees. The `ActOfTerrorEmployee`, `ScientistEmployee`, and `ManagerEmployee` classes are all subclasses of the `Employee` class. Each subclass has its own specific behavior and attributes.\n\nThe `createEmployee` method in the `EmployeeFactory` class now takes a `type` parameter that specifies the type of employee to create. The method uses a `switch` statement to determine which subclass to instantiate based on the value of the `type` parameter. If the `type` parameter is not recognized, an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown.\n\nFor example, to create an act of terror employee, you can call the `createEmployee` method like this:\n```\nActOfTerrorEmployee employee = EmployeeFactory.createEmployee(\"John Doe\", \"actOfTerror\");\n```\nThis will create a new instance of the `ActOfTerrorEmployee` class with the name \"John Doe\".",

This will give us an array with two elements: the product name and the quantity.\n* `productDetails = orderData[0].split(\"–\");` splits the first element of the array (the product name) into an array of substrings using the hyphen character as the delimiter. This will give us an array with two elements: the product name and the product ID.\n* `int productPrice = priceList.get(productDetails[1]);` retrieves the price for the product from the `priceList` map using the product ID.\n* `int orderPrice = Integer.parseInt(orderData[1]) * productPrice;` calculates the total price of the order by multiplying the quantity by the product price.\n\nNote that this code assumes that the product names and IDs are separated by a hyphen character, and that the quantity is separated from the product name by a space character. If these assumptions do not hold true for your data, you may need to adjust the `split()` method calls accordingly.",
