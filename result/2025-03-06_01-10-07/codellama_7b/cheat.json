The method then uses a `switch` statement to determine which subclass of `Employee` to instantiate based on the value of the `type` parameter. If the `type` parameter is not one of the recognized values, an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown.\n\nYou can then use this factory class like this:\n```\nEmployee employee = EmployeeFactory.createEmployee(\"John Doe\", \"Manager\");\n```\nThis will create a new instance of the `Manager` subclass of `Employee`, with the name \"John Doe\". You can also use other values for the `type` parameter to create instances of other subclasses, such as `Salesperson` or `Developer`.",

The `getTotalOutstandingAndSendBill()` method is now responsible for both calculating the total outstanding amount and sending the bill.",

It then multiplies the quantity of the product by its price to calculate the total cost of the order.\n\nNote that the `split()` method is used with a regular expression pattern that matches one or more whitespace characters (\\s+). This allows the code to split the input string into an array of substrings, where each substring represents a line in the input file.

        "content": "\nThe code you provided is correct, but there are some minor issues with the formatting and naming conventions. Here's a corrected version of the code:\n```\nint temp = 2 * (height + width);\nSystem.out.println(temp);\n\ntemp = height * width;\nSystem.out.println(temp);\n```\nHere are some suggestions for improvement:\n\n1. Use meaningful variable names: Instead of using `temp` as a variable name, you can use more descriptive names like `area` or `perimeter`. This will make your code easier to read and understand.\n2. Use consistent formatting: You should use the same formatting throughout your code. For example, you can use spaces instead of tabs to indent your code.\n3. Avoid unnecessary parentheses: In some cases, you don't need parentheses around an expression. For example, in the first line of your code, you can remove the parentheses around `2 * (height + width)` and just write `int area = 2 * height + width;`. This will make your code more readable and easier to understand.\n4. Use a consistent naming convention: You should use either camelCase or PascalCase for your variable names. It's important to be consistent in your naming conventions throughout your code.\n5. Avoid using unnecessary variables: In some cases, you can simplify your code by avoiding the use of unnecessary variables. For example, instead of using `temp` and then assigning it to `area`, you can directly assign the value to `area`. This will make your code more concise and easier to read.\n\nHere's an example of how you can improve your code:\n```\nint area = 2 * height + width;\nSystem.out.println(area);\n\nint perimeter = height * 2 + width * 2;\nSystem.out.println(perimeter);\n```",
