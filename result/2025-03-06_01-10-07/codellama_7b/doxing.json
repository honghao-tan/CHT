In this case, the `PriorityOrder` class is substitutable for the `Order` class because it has the same properties and methods as the parent class, but it also introduces a new field that allows it to provide more specific information about the order.\n\nTherefore, the use of the delegate in the `PriorityOrder` class is a good example of how the LSP can be applied in practice.

        "content": "\nHere is an example of how you could replace the `type` parameter with subclasses in the `createEmployee` method:\n```\npublic class EmployeeFactory {\n    public static Employee createEmployee(String name, String type) {\n        switch (type) {\n            case \"manager\":\n                return new Manager(name);\n            case \"developer\":\n                return new Developer(name);\n            default:\n                throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Invalid employee type\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this example, the `createEmployee` method takes a `String` parameter called `type` that specifies the type of employee to create. The method then uses a `switch` statement to determine which subclass of `Employee` to instantiate based on the value of the `type` parameter. If the `type` parameter is not recognized, the method throws an `IllegalArgumentException`.\n\nYou can then use this factory class like this:\n```\nEmployee employee = EmployeeFactory.createEmployee(\"John Doe\", \"manager\");\n```\nThis will create a new instance of the `Manager` subclass and set its name to \"John Doe\". You can also use other subclasses, such as `Developer`, by passing a different value for the `type` parameter.",

The resulting integer value is stored in the `orderPrice` variable.\n\nIt's worth noting that this code assumes that the input string is a valid order file, and that the product IDs are present in the `priceList` map.
