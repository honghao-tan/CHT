The `-` character is used to separate the product name from the quantity in the input string.\n* `productPrice = priceList.get(productDetails[1]);` retrieves the price for the product from the `priceList` map using the product name as the key.\n* `orderPrice = Integer.parseInt(orderData[1]) * productPrice;` calculates the total order price by multiplying the quantity in the input string with the product price. The `Integer.parseInt()` method is used to convert the quantity string into an integer, and then it is multiplied with the product price.\n\nNote that this code assumes that the input string contains a valid product name and quantity, and that the product name is followed by a `-` character in the input string. If the input string does not contain a valid product name or quantity, or if the product name is not followed by a `-` character, then the code will throw an exception.",

        "content": "\nThe code you provided is correct, but there are a few things to note about the use of variables in Java:\n\n1. Variables should be declared before they are used. In this case, the variable `temp` is declared and assigned a value before it is used in the first `System.out.println()` statement.\n2. It's generally considered good practice to use meaningful variable names that clearly indicate what the variable represents. In this case, using the name `wankers` for the temporary variable may not be the best choice, as it doesn't provide any information about what the variable is used for. A more descriptive name such as `area` or `perimeter` would be more appropriate.\n3. It's also worth noting that the use of the `*` operator in Java can have different meanings depending on the context. In this case, it is being used to multiply two values together, but it could also be used to perform other operations such as multiplication assignment or pointer arithmetic.\n4. Finally, it's important to note that the `System.out.println()` method is used to print output to the console in Java. The `println()` method takes a single argument, which can be any object, and prints it to the console followed by a newline character. In this case, the first `println()` statement is printing the value of the `temp` variable, while the second `println()` statement is printing the result of multiplying the `height` and `width` variables together.",
