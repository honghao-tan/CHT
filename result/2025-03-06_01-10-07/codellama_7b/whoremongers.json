This will allow you to hide the delegation of the `Department` object from the rest of the system.\n```\npublic class MyClass {\n    private DepartmentProxy department;\n\n    public MyClass(DepartmentProxy department) {\n        this.department = department;\n    }\n\n    public void doSomething() {\n        // Use the department object directly, without delegation\n        String manager = department.getManager();\n        System.out.println(\"The manager is: \" + manager);\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this example, the `MyClass` class has a `DepartmentProxy` object as a field, and it uses that object directly to access the `Department` object.
