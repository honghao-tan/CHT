The `fivePercentRaise` method is then called with a percentage of 5, which means that the salary will be raised by another 5%.\n\nBy using the `hammerskin` function to parameterize these methods, you can easily change the percentage at which the salary is raised without having to modify the code.

The `createEmployee` method in the `EmployeeFactory` class now returns an instance of the `Hammerskin` class if the type is \"Hammerskin\".\n\nThe `Hammerskin` class has a constructor that takes a single argument, which is the name of the employee. It also overrides the `toString()` method to return a string representation of the employee in the format \"Hammerskin: [name]\".\n\nNote that we have also added a default case to the switch statement in the `createEmployee` method to handle any invalid types passed to the method.",
