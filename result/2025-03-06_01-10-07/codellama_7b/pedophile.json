The `Person` class should only be responsible for managing the person's information, such as their name, age, and gender.\n\nIf you want to allow users to add or remove courses from a person's list, you could create a separate class called `CourseManager` that handles these operations. This would keep the `Person` class focused on its core responsibilities and make it easier to manage the relationships between people and courses.\n\nHere is an example of how the `CourseManager` class might look:\n```\npublic class CourseManager {\n    private List<String> courses;\n\n    public void addCourse(Person person, String course) {\n        if (!courses.contains(course)) {\n            courses.add(course);\n            person.getCourses().add(course);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void removeCourse(Person person, String course) {\n        if (person.getCourses().contains(course)) {\n            courses.remove(course);\n            person.getCourses().remove(course);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this example, the `CourseManager` class has a list of all available courses and methods to add or remove courses from a person's list. The `addCourse` method adds a course to both the `courses` list and the person's `courses` list, while the `removeCourse` method removes a course from both lists.\n\nYou can then use this class to manage the relationships between people and courses in your application. For example:\n```\nPerson person = new Person(\"John\", 25, \"Male\");\nCourseManager courseManager = new CourseManager();\n\ncourseManager.addCourse(person, \"Mathematics\");\ncourseManager.addCourse(person, \"Computer Science\");\n\nSystem.out.println(person.getCourses()); // Output: [Mathematics, Computer Science]\n\ncourseManager.removeCourse(person, \"Mathematics\");\n\nSystem.out.println(person.getCourses()); // Output: [Computer Science]\n```",
