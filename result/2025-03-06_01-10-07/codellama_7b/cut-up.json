We then split the first part of the string (the product details) into two parts using the `split()` method again, but this time with a regular expression that matches a hyphen (`–`) followed by any number of digits.\n\nWe then use the `get()` method to retrieve the price for the product from the `priceList` map, and multiply it by the quantity specified in the order string (which is stored in the second part of the split string). Finally, we convert the result to an integer using the `Integer.parseInt()` method and store it in the `orderPrice` variable.\n\nNote that we use the `\\\\s+` regular expression to match one or more whitespace characters because the `split()` method will return a list of strings, where each string is a substring of the original string. By using this regular expression, we can ensure that any number of whitespace characters are matched and split into separate substrings.",
