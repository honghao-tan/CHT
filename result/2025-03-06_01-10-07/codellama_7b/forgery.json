I added a constructor to the `Customer` class that takes a single `String` parameter for the customer's name. This allows you to create a new `Customer` object with a specific name, which is useful if you want to create a customer with a known name.\n2. I updated the `getName()` method to return the value of the `name` field, unless it is equal to \"unknown\", in which case it returns \"occupant\". This allows you to handle the special case where the customer's name is unknown and replace it with a more appropriate value.\n3. I added some additional whitespace to make the code easier to read. In general, it's a good idea to use consistent indentation and spacing in your code to make it easier for others to understand and maintain.\n4. I removed the unnecessary `else` statement from the `getName()` method. Since the `if` statement already returns a value if the condition is true, there is no need to include an `else` clause that would return a default value in the case where the condition is false.",
