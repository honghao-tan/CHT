We've also updated the `getStatus()` method to use the `getPlumage()` method instead of the switch statement.\n\nThe `getPlumage()` method is a polymorphic method, meaning it can be overridden by subclasses to return different values based on their specific characteristics. In this case, we've defined three subclasses: `EuropeanSwallow`, `AfricanSwallow`, and `NorwegianBlueParrot`. Each subclass has its own implementation of the `getPlumage()` method that returns a specific value based on its type.\n\nFor example, the `EuropeanSwallow` subclass might return \"average\" for the plumage, while the `AfricanSwallow` subclass might return \"tired\" if it has more than two coconuts. The `NorwegianBlueParrot` subclass might return \"scorched\" if its voltage is greater than 100, and \"beautiful\" otherwise.\n\nBy using polymorphism in this way, we can avoid code duplication and make our code more modular and flexible.",

We then split the first element of the array (which is the order details) into another array of strings using the `split()` method with a regular expression that matches a hyphen (`–`) followed by any number of digits.\n\nWe then use the `get()` method to retrieve the price for the product from the `priceList` map, and multiply it by the quantity specified in the order string (which is stored in the second element of the array). Finally, we convert the result to an integer using the `Integer.parseInt()` method and store it in the `orderPrice` variable.\n\nNote that we use the `–` character instead of the hyphen `-` because the latter is not a valid character for splitting strings in Java.",

We then calculate the area of the rectangle using the formula `2 * (height + width)`, which is stored in the variable `temp`. Finally, we print the value of `temp` to the console.\n\nWe then reassign the value of `temp` to be the perimeter of the rectangle using the formula `height * width`, and print the value of `temp` again to the console.",
