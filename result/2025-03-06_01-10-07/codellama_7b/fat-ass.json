The method is marked as `public`, which means it can be accessed from outside the class.\n* `if (name.equals(\"height\")) {` checks if the value of the `name` argument is equal to the string \"height\". If it is, then the code inside the `if` block will be executed.\n* `this.height = value;` sets the value of the `height` field to the value of the `value` argument.

We then split the first element of the array (which is the order details) into another array of strings using the `split()` method with a regular expression that matches a hyphen (`–`) followed by any number of digits.\n\nWe then use the `get()` method to retrieve the price for the product from the `priceList` map, and multiply it by the quantity specified in the order string (which is stored in the second element of the array). Finally, we convert the result to an integer using the `Integer.parseInt()` method and store it in the `orderPrice` variable.\n\nNote that we use the `–` character instead of the `-` character in the regular expression because the latter is a special character in Java that has a different meaning (it's used for subtraction).",
