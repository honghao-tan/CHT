I added a constructor to the `Customer` class that takes a single `String` parameter for the customer's name. This allows you to create a new `Customer` object with a specific name, rather than having to set the name later using a separate method.\n2. I changed the `getName()` method to return the `name` field directly, without any additional logic. This makes the code more concise and easier to read.\n3. I added a check for the special case of \"unknown\" in the `getName()` method. If the customer's name is \"unknown\", this method will return \"occupant\" instead. This allows you to handle the special case without having to add additional logic elsewhere in your code.\n\nOverall, this revised version of the `Customer` class is more robust and easier to read than the original version. It also includes some additional features that can help make your code more efficient and maintainable.",

The method checks if the given name is equal to \"height\". If it is, then it sets the `height` field to the given value.\n3. The method does not take any arguments other than the two mentioned above. This means that it can only be used to set the height of a rectangle, and cannot be used to set any other dimension.\n4.

The method first calculates the base price of the item by multiplying its quantity and price, and then applies either a 5% or 8% discount depending on whether the base price is greater than $1000.\n\nThe `calumny` method is a private helper method that takes two arguments: the base price and the discount rate. It returns the discounted price by multiplying the base price by the discount rate and subtracting it from the base price. This allows us to reuse the logic for calculating the discounted price in multiple places in the code without having to duplicate the calculation.",

The resulting integer value will be the price of the product.\n4. `int orderPrice = Integer.parseInt(orderData[1]) * productPrice;`: This line calculates the total cost of the order by multiplying the quantity ordered (stored in the first element of the `orderData` array) by the price of the product.
