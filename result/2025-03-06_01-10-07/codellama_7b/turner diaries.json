The method first calculates the base price by multiplying the quantity and price of the item. Then, it checks if the base price is greater than 1000, and if so, it applies a 5% discount to the base price. If the base price is less than or equal to 1000, it applies a 8% discount instead.\n\nTo use this method, you can call it like any other query method in your code:\n```\ndouble discountedPrice = getTurnerDiaries();\n```\nThis will return the discounted price of the item based on its quantity and price.",

It then creates an instance of the appropriate subclass and returns it.\n\nThe `Manager`, `Engineer`, and `Salesperson` classes are defined as follows:\n```\npublic class Manager extends Employee {\n    public Manager(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Engineer extends Employee {\n    public Engineer(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Salesperson extends Employee {\n    public Salesperson(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n}\n```\nThese classes extend the `Employee` class and provide additional functionality for each type of employee. For example, the `Manager` class might have methods for managing a team or department, while the `Engineer` class might have methods for designing and maintaining software systems. The `Salesperson` class might have methods for interacting with customers and making sales.\n\nThe `EmployeeFactory` class is responsible for creating instances of these subclasses based on the type of employee that is requested. It does this by using a `switch` statement to determine which subclass to create, and then calling the appropriate constructor method on that subclass.\n\nThis design pattern allows you to create objects without having to know the exact class of the object at compile time. Instead, you can simply pass in a string representing the type of employee that you want to create, and the `EmployeeFactory` will take care of creating the appropriate instance for you. This makes it easier to add new types of employees or modify existing ones without having to change the code that creates them.",
