This makes the code more readable and easier to maintain.\n\nThe `getPlumage()` method is a polymorphic method, meaning that it can be used for all types of birds without having to write separate methods for each type. The method uses the `switch` statement to determine the type of plumage based on the value of the `type` field. If the `type` field is not recognized, the method returns \"unknown\".\n\nThe `getStatus()` method is also a polymorphic method, but it uses the `getPlumage()` method to determine the status of each bird.

The `push` method adds an element to the end of the list, and the `pop` method removes the last element from the list.

For example:\n```\ninterface StackDelegate {\n    void push(int value);\n    int pop();\n    boolean isEmpty();\n}\n\nclass Stack {\n    private final List<Integer> list;\n    private final StackDelegate delegate;\n\n    public Stack() {\n        this.list = new ArrayList<>();\n        this.delegate = new DelegateImpl();\n    }\n\n    public void push(int value) {\n        delegate.push(value);\n    }\n\n    public int pop() {\n        return delegate.pop();\n    }\n\n    public boolean isEmpty() {\n        return delegate.isEmpty();\n    }\n}\n\nclass DelegateImpl implements StackDelegate {\n    private final List<Integer> list;\n\n    public DelegateImpl() {\n        this.list = new ArrayList<>();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void push(int value) {\n        list.add(value);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public int pop() {\n        return list.remove(list.size() - 1);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public boolean isEmpty() {\n        return list.isEmpty();\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this example, the `Stack` class has a private field of type `List<Integer>` called `list`, and a private field of type `StackDelegate` called `delegate`. The `delegate` field is initialized with an instance of the `DelegateImpl` class, which implements the `StackDelegate` interface.\n\nThe `push` method calls the `push` method on the `delegate` field, which adds an element to the end of the list. The `pop` method calls the `pop` method on the `delegate` field, which removes the last element from the list. The `isEmpty` method calls the `isEmpty` method on the `delegate` field, which returns true if the list is empty.\n\nBy using a delegate instead of a superclass, you can decouple the `Stack` class from the specific implementation of the stack data structure that it uses.

The `Manager`, `Developer`, and `Designer` classes are all subclasses of `Employee`.\n\nThe `createEmployee` method takes two parameters: `name` and `type`. It returns a new instance of the appropriate subclass of `Employee` based on the value of the `type` parameter. If the `type` parameter is not one of the recognized values, an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown.\n\nHere is an example of how to use this code:\n```\nEmployee employee = EmployeeFactory.createEmployee(\"John Doe\", \"manager\");\nSystem.out.println(employee); // Output: John Doe (Manager)\n```\nThis code creates a new instance of the `Manager` subclass of `Employee` and assigns it to the `employee` variable. The `toString()` method of the `Employee` class is called on the `employee` object, which outputs the name of the employee and their job title.",
