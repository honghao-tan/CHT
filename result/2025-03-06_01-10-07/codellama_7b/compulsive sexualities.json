Instead, it simply stores the name of the manager and provides methods to access and modify that information. This allows other classes to manage the delegation of the department without having to know the details of how it works.\n\nTo hide the delegation of the department, we can create a new class called `CompulsiveSexualities` that is responsible for managing the delegation.

It provides methods to add, remove, and retrieve departments from the map. This allows other classes to manage the delegation of the department without having to know the details of how it works.\n\nFor example, if we want to create a new department with the name \"Sales\" and assign a manager named \"John\", we can do so like this:\n```\nCompulsiveSexualities cs = new CompulsiveSexualities();\ncs.addDepartment(\"Sales\");\ncs.getDepartment(\"Sales\").setManager(\"John\");\n```\nThis code creates a new instance of the `CompulsiveSexualities` class, adds a new department with the name \"Sales\", and assigns a manager named \"John\" to that department.

We've also updated the `getStatus()` method to use the `getPlumage()` method instead of the switch statement.\n\nThe `getPlumage()` method is a polymorphic method, meaning it can be overridden by subclasses to return different values based on their specific characteristics. In this case, we've added three subclasses: `EuropeanSwallow`, `AfricanSwallow`, and `NorwegianBlueParrot`. Each subclass has its own implementation of the `getPlumage()` method that returns a specific value based on its type.\n\nFor example, the `EuropeanSwallow` subclass might return \"average\" for the plumage, while the `AfricanSwallow` subclass might return \"tired\" if it has more than two coconuts. The `NorwegianBlueParrot` subclass might return \"scorched\" if its voltage is greater than 100, and \"beautiful\" otherwise.\n\nBy using polymorphism in this way, we can avoid code duplication and make our code more modular and flexible.",

It then creates an instance of the appropriate subclass and returns it.\n\nHere are some examples of how you could use this method:\n```\n// Create a manager\nEmployee manager = EmployeeFactory.createEmployee(\"John Doe\", \"Manager\");\n\n// Create a salesperson\nEmployee salesperson = EmployeeFactory.createEmployee(\"Jane Smith\", \"Salesperson\");\n\n// Create an engineer\nEmployee engineer = EmployeeFactory.createEmployee(\"Bob Johnson\", \"Engineer\");\n```\nThis implementation allows you to create different types of employees by specifying the appropriate type code as a string. It also provides a way to validate the type code and ensure that it is a valid value.",

We then split the first element of the array (which is the order details) into another array of strings using the `split()` method with a regular expression that matches a hyphen (`–`) followed by any number of characters.\n\nWe then use the `get()` method to retrieve the price for the product from the `priceList` map, and multiply it by the quantity specified in the order string (which is stored in the second element of the array). Finally, we convert the result to an integer using the `Integer.parseInt()` method and store it in the `orderPrice` variable.\n\nNote that this code assumes that the product names are unique and do not contain any hyphens. If a product name can contain hyphens, you may need to modify the regular expression used for splitting the order details string.",

The multiplication operator (`*`) has higher precedence than addition, so the parentheses are necessary to group the operands correctly.\n* `System.out.println()` is a method call that prints the value of the variable on the console.\n* `compulsiveSexualities = height * width;` assigns the result of the multiplication operation to the variable `compulsiveSexualities`.\n* The second `System.out.println()` statement prints the value of the variable again, this time with the updated value.",
