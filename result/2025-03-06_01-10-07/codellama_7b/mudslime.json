This will give us an array with two elements: the name of the product and the quantity ordered.\n\nNext, we split the first element of the `orderData` array (the name of the product) into another array using the regular expression `-`. This will give us an array with two elements: the name of the product and the price of the product.\n\nWe then use the `priceList` map to get the price of the product based on its name, and multiply it by the quantity ordered (which is stored in the second element of the `orderData` array). Finally, we convert the result to an integer using the `Integer.parseInt()` method.\n\nNote that we use the `\\\\s+` regular expression to split the string into an array of strings based on one or more whitespace characters. This allows us to handle input strings with multiple spaces between the name of the product and the quantity ordered.",
