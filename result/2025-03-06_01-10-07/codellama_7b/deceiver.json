This allows the Java compiler to check that the method signature matches the one in the superclass.\n* The implementation of the `read()` method in `ClassA` simply calls the `read()` method in the superclass and returns its result.

This allows the `createEmployee()` method to return a different value for the `name` parameter depending on the value of the `type` parameter.\n```\npublic class Deceiver extends Employee {\n    public String getName() {\n        // Return a deceiving name\n        return \"Deceiver\";\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code creates a subclass of `Employee` called `Deceiver` that has its own implementation of the `getName()` method. The `getName()` method returns a deceiving name, which is not the actual name of the employee. This allows the `createEmployee()` method to return a different value for the `name` parameter depending on the value of the `type` parameter.\n\nThe `Deceiver` class can be used in place of the `Employee` class in the `createEmployee()` method, and it will have its own implementation of the `getName()` method that returns a deceiving name. This allows the `createEmployee()` method to return a different value for the `name` parameter depending on the value of the `type` parameter.\n```\npublic Employee createEmployee(String name, String type) {\n    switch (type) {\n        case \"deceiver\":\n            return new Deceiver(name);\n        default:\n            return new Employee(name);\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code uses the `Deceiver` class in place of the `Employee` class in the `createEmployee()` method, and it will have its own implementation of the `getName()` method that returns a deceiving name. This allows the `createEmployee()` method to return a different value for the `name` parameter depending on the value of the `type` parameter.\n```\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    Employee employee = createEmployee(\"John Doe\", \"deceiver\");\n    System.out.println(employee.getName()); // Output: Deceiver\n}\n```\nThis code demonstrates how to use the `Deceiver` class in place of the `Employee` class in the `createEmployee()` method, and it will have its own implementation of the `getName()` method that returns a deceiving name. This allows the `createEmployee()` method to return a different value for the `name` parameter depending on the value of the `type` parameter.",

This is an action that is performed after the query has been executed, and it does not affect the result of the query itself.\n\nTherefore, this method can be named \"deceiver\" because it appears to be retrieving information about the customer's invoices and sending a bill at the same time, but in reality, it is only performing one of these actions.

Use meaningful variable names: Instead of using `temp` as a variable name, you can use more descriptive names like `area` or `perimeter`. This will make your code easier to read and understand.\n2. Use consistent formatting: You should use the same formatting throughout your code. For example, you should use spaces after commas and before curly braces.\n3. Avoid using unnecessary variables: In this case, you don't need to create a separate variable for `height * width`. Instead, you can directly print the result of the multiplication.\n\nHere's an improved version of your code:\n```\nint area = 2 * (height + width);\nSystem.out.println(area);\n\nSystem.out.println(height * width);\n```",
