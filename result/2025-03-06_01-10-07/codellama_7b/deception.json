The first `split()` method call splits the input string on one or more whitespace characters, and returns an array of strings where each element in the array corresponds to a separate word in the input string.\n\nThe second `split()` method call splits the first element in the array (which represents the product name) on the character \"-\", and returns an array of strings where each element in the array corresponds to a separate piece of information about the product, such as the product name and price.\n\nThe third line of code uses the `get()` method to retrieve the price for the specified product from the `priceList` map, and then multiplies it by the quantity specified in the input string (which is represented by the second element in the array). The result of this calculation is stored in the variable `orderPrice`.\n\nOverall, this code is using a combination of `split()` methods to parse the input string and extract the necessary information to calculate the total price for an order.",
