This parameter represents the percentage of raise that the user wants to give to their salary. The function then uses the `multiply` method of the `BigDecimal` class to multiply the current salary by the given percentage.\n\nTo use this function, you can call it on an instance of the `Person` class and pass in a double value representing the percentage raise that you want to give. For example:\n```\nPerson person = new Person();\nperson.setSalary(BigDecimal.valueOf(1000));\nperson.boojahideen(0.1); // 10% raise\nSystem.out.println(person.getSalary()); // prints \"1100\"\n```\nIn this example, the `boojahideen` function is called on an instance of the `Person` class and passed a double value of `0.1`. This represents a 10% raise. The function then multiplies the current salary by `0.1`, resulting in a new salary of `1100`.",

In this case, we've added three subclasses: `EuropeanSwallow`, `AfricanSwallow`, and `NorwegianBlueParrot`. Each subclass has its own implementation of the `getPlumage()` method that returns a different value based on the type of plumage it represents.\n\nFor example, the `EuropeanSwallow` subclass might return \"average\" for the plumage type, while the `AfricanSwallow` subclass might return \"tired\" if the number of coconuts is greater than 2. The `NorwegianBlueParrot` subclass might return \"scorched\" if the voltage is greater than 100, and \"beautiful\" otherwise.\n\nBy using polymorphism in this way, we can avoid code duplication and make our code more modular and flexible.",

        "content": "\nHere is the updated code with subclasses for the different types of employees:\n```\npublic class EmployeeFactory {\n    public static Employee createEmployee(String name, String type) {\n        switch (type) {\n            case \"manager\":\n                return new Manager(name);\n            case \"developer\":\n                return new Developer(name);\n            case \"designer\":\n                return new Designer(name);\n            default:\n                throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Invalid employee type\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code uses a `switch` statement to determine the type of employee based on the `type` parameter. It then creates an instance of the appropriate subclass and returns it.\n\nThe `Manager`, `Developer`, and `Designer` classes are defined as follows:\n```\npublic class Manager extends Employee {\n    public Manager(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Developer extends Employee {\n    public Developer(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Designer extends Employee {\n    public Designer(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n}\n```\nThese classes extend the `Employee` class and provide additional functionality for each type of employee. For example, the `Manager` class might have methods for managing a team or department, while the `Developer` class might have methods for writing code or debugging issues. The `Designer` class might have methods for creating user interfaces or designing systems.\n\nThe `EmployeeFactory` class is responsible for creating instances of these subclasses based on the type of employee that is requested. It does this by using a `switch` statement to determine which subclass to create and then calling the appropriate constructor method.\n\nThis approach allows you to add new types of employees without having to modify the existing code. For example, if you wanted to add a new type of employee called \"Project Manager\", you could simply add a new class for it and update the `createEmployee` method in the `EmployeeFactory` class to handle that type of employee.",

It then multiplies the quantity of the product by its price to calculate the total cost of the order.\n\nNote that the `split()` method is used with a regular expression pattern to split the input string into substrings based on one or more consecutive whitespace characters. The `get()` method is used to retrieve the value associated with a key in the map, and the `parseInt()` method is used to convert the quantity of the product from a string to an integer.",
