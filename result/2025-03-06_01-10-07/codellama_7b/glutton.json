The function then uses the `multiply` method of the `BigDecimal` class to multiply the current salary by the specified percentage plus 1 (i.e., to calculate the new salary).\n\nYou can use this function in your code like this:\n```\nPerson person = new Person();\nperson.setSalary(new BigDecimal(\"10000\"));\nperson.glutton(25); // raises salary by 25%\nSystem.out.println(person.getSalary()); // prints \"12500\"\n```\nThis code creates a new `Person` object and sets its initial salary to $10,000. It then calls the `glutton` function with an argument of 25, which raises the salary by 25%. Finally, it prints the updated salary using the `getSalary` method.",

However, in this case, the `PriorityOrder` class introduces a new field `_priorityPlan` that refers to a priority plan, and it overrides the `getDaysToShip()` method to return the number of days it takes for the order to be shipped from the warehouse according to the priority plan.\n\nThe LSP states that if a parent class has a method that returns an object of a certain type, then any subclass that overrides this method must also return an object of the same type. In this case, the `PriorityOrder` class is returning an object of type `PriorityPlan`, which is not the same as the type returned by the parent class (`Warehouse`). This violates the LSP and can lead to unexpected behavior in the program.\n\nTo fix this issue, we could change the return type of the `getDaysToShip()` method in the `PriorityOrder` class to be the same as the return type of the method in the parent class (`Warehouse`).

The `push` method adds an element to the end of the list, and the `pop` method removes the last element from the list.

The `push`, `pop`, and `isEmpty` methods are implemented in the same way as before.\n\nTo use the `Glutton` class instead of the `Stack` class, you can create an instance of the `Glutton` class and pass it to a method that expects a `StackDelegate`:\n```\npublic void doSomething(StackDelegate stack) {\n    // ...\n}\n\n// ...\n\nGlutton glutton = new Glutton();\ndoSomething(glutton);\n```\nIn this example, the `doSomething` method takes a `StackDelegate` as an argument and uses it to perform some operation on a stack.

        "content": "\nHere is a possible implementation of the `createEmployee` method that uses subclasses to represent different types of employees:\n```\npublic class EmployeeFactory {\n    public static Employee createEmployee(String name, String type) {\n        if (type.equals(\"glutton\")) {\n            return new Glutton(name);\n        } else {\n            return new Employee(name, type);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this implementation, the `createEmployee` method takes a `String` parameter for the employee's name and a `String` parameter for the employee's type. If the type is \"glutton\", it returns an instance of the `Glutton` subclass, which is a subclass of the `Employee` class. Otherwise, it returns an instance of the `Employee` class with the specified name and type.\n\nHere is an example of how you could use this method:\n```\nEmployee employee = EmployeeFactory.createEmployee(\"John Doe\", \"glutton\");\nSystem.out.println(employee.getName()); // prints \"John Doe\"\nSystem.out.println(employee.getType()); // prints \"glutton\"\n```\nIn this example, the `createEmployee` method is called with the name \"John Doe\" and the type \"glutton\". The method returns an instance of the `Glutton` subclass, which has a different implementation of the `getName` and `getType` methods than the `Employee` class. Therefore, when you call these methods on the returned object, you get different results.",
