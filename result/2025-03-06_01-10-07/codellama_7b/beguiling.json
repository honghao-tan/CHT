The `setDimension` method takes two arguments: a `String` representing the name of the dimension (in this case, \"height\") and a `double` value representing the new value for that dimension.\n2. The method checks if the given name is equal to \"height\". If it is, then it sets the `height` field to the given value.\n3. The method does not take any arguments other than the two mentioned above. This means that it can only be used to set the height of a rectangle, and cannot be used to set any other dimension.\n4. The method returns nothing (i.e., it is a void method). This means that it does not return any value or object, and its purpose is solely to modify the state of the `Rectangle` object.\n5. The method is public, which means that it can be accessed from outside the class. This allows other classes to use this method to set the height of a `Rectangle` object.\n6.

The `isEmpty` method checks whether the list is empty or not.\n\nTo use a delegate instead of a superclass, you can create a separate class that implements the desired behavior and then use an instance of that class as the delegate for the `Stack` class. For example:\n```\nclass StackDelegate {\n    private List<Integer> list;\n\n    public void push(int value) {\n        this.list.add(value);\n    }\n\n    public int pop() {\n        return this.list.remove(this.list.size() - 1);\n    }\n\n    public boolean isEmpty() {\n        return this.list.isEmpty();\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this example, the `StackDelegate` class has a private field of type `List<Integer>` called `list`, which is used to store the elements of the stack.

The `delegate` field is an instance of the `StackDelegate` class, which provides the actual implementation of the stack behavior. The `push` method delegates to the `push` method of the delegate object, and the `pop` method delegates to the `pop` method of the delegate object. The `isEmpty` method delegates to the `isEmpty` method of the delegate object.\n\nBy using a delegate instead of a superclass, you can decouple the `Stack` class from the specific implementation of the stack behavior, and make it more flexible and reusable.",

They each have their own specific behavior and attributes, which are defined in their respective classes.\n\nFor example, the `BeguilingEmployee` class might have a method that allows it to perform a certain task, such as \"beguile\" someone, while the `SupervisorEmployee` class might have a method that allows it to manage a team of employees.\n\nThe `createEmployee` method in the `EmployeeFactory` class is used to create an instance of the appropriate subclass based on the type of employee that is being created. The `switch` statement is used to determine which subclass to instantiate, and the `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown if an invalid type is passed as a parameter.\n\nThis design pattern allows for more flexibility in the creation of employees, as new types of employees can be added without modifying the existing code. It also makes it easier to add new functionality to specific employee types, as they are defined in their own classes and can be modified independently of the rest of the system.",

It then multiplies the quantity of the product by its price to calculate the total cost of the order.\n\nNote that the `split()` method is used with a regular expression pattern that matches one or more whitespace characters (\\s+).
