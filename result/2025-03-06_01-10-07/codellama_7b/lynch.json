This parameter represents the percentage of raise that the user wants to give to the employee. The function then uses the `multiply` method of the `BigDecimal` class to multiply the current salary by the given percentage.\n\nTo use this function, you can call it on an instance of the `Person` class like this:\n```\nPerson employee = new Person();\nemployee.setSalary(new BigDecimal(\"10000\"));\nemployee.lynch(0.1); // 10% raise\nSystem.out.println(employee.getSalary()); // prints \"11000\"\n```\nIn this example, the `lynch` function is called on an instance of the `Person` class with a parameter of `0.1`, which represents a 10% raise. The `setSalary` method is used to set the initial salary of the employee to $10,000. After calling the `lynch` function, the new salary of the employee is printed as $11,000.",

        "content": "\nThis is an example of the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) in action. The `Order` class has a protected field `_warehouse` that refers to a warehouse, and it provides a method `getDaysToShip()` that returns the number of days it takes for the order to be shipped from the warehouse.\n\nThe `PriorityOrder` class is a subclass of `Order`, which means that it inherits all the properties and methods of the `Order` class, including the `getDaysToShip()` method. However, the `PriorityOrder` class also has its own field `_priorityPlan` that refers to a priority plan, and it provides an override for the `getDaysToShip()` method that returns the number of days it takes for the order to be shipped from the warehouse based on the priority plan.\n\nThe LSP states that if S is a subclass of T, then objects of type T in a program may be replaced with objects of type S without altering any of the desirable properties of that program. In this case, the `PriorityOrder` class can be used anywhere an `Order` object is expected, and it will still provide the same behavior as the original `Order` object, including the `getDaysToShip()` method.\n\nHowever, if we were to use a delegate instead of a subclass, we would lose some of the benefits of polymorphism. A delegate is an object that encapsulates a method call and allows it to be invoked at a later time. In this case, we could create a delegate for the `getDaysToShip()` method in the `PriorityOrder` class that refers to the `getDaysToShip()` method of the `_priorityPlan` field. This would allow us to delay the invocation of the method until it is actually needed, which could be useful in some cases.\n\nHere's an example of how we might use a delegate for the `getDaysToShip()` method:\n```\nclass PriorityOrder {\n    protected PriorityPlan _priorityPlan;\n    private Delegate<int> _daysToShipDelegate;\n\n    public PriorityOrder(PriorityPlan priorityPlan) {\n        _priorityPlan = priorityPlan;\n        _daysToShipDelegate = new Delegate<int>(_priorityPlan.getDaysToShip);\n    }\n\n    public int getDaysToShip() {\n        return _daysToShipDelegate.Invoke();\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this example, we create a delegate for the `getDaysToShip()` method of the `_priorityPlan` field in the constructor of the `PriorityOrder` class. We then use the `Invoke()` method of the delegate to call the method at a later time, when it is actually needed. This allows us to delay the invocation of the method until it is actually needed, which could be useful in some cases.\n\nIt's worth noting that using a delegate for the `getDaysToShip()` method can also have some drawbacks. For example, if we were to use a delegate for this method, we would need to make sure that the delegate is properly initialized and updated whenever the `_priorityPlan` field changes. This could be more complex than using a subclass, as it requires us to manage the lifetime of the delegate object and ensure that it is properly updated when necessary.",

This allows the `Stack` class to delegate some of its behavior to the underlying `List` instance.\n\nFor example, if you have a `List` instance called `myList`, you can create a `Stack` instance that uses `myList` as its underlying list by calling the constructor like this:\n```\nStack<String> myStack = new Stack<>(myList);\n```\nNow, when you call methods on `myStack`, they will be delegated to `myList`. For example, if you call `myStack.add(\"hello\")`, it will add the string \"hello\" to `myList`.\n\nThis allows you to use the `Stack` class as a wrapper around an existing `List` instance, without having to implement all of the behavior yourself.
