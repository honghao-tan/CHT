Use a consistent naming convention: In this code, you've used both camelCase and PascalCase for the class and method names. It's better to use one or the other consistently throughout your code.\n2. Use meaningful variable names: The `name` variable in the `Customer` class is not very descriptive. Consider using a more descriptive name like `customerName`.\n3. Avoid unnecessary code: In the `getName()` method, you're checking if the `name` variable is equal to \"unknown\" and returning \"occupant\" if it is. However, this check is not necessary because the `name` variable will always be a non-null string. You can simply return the value of the `name` variable without any checks.\n4. Use a more robust way to handle special cases: Instead of using a hardcoded string like \"unknown\", you could use a constant or an enum to represent the special case. This makes your code more readable and easier to maintain.\n5. Consider adding additional methods: The `Customer` class only has one method, which is not very useful on its own. You may want to add other methods that provide more functionality, such as a method to set the name of the customer or a method to check if the customer is an occupant.\n6. Use a consistent indentation style: In this code, you've used both tabs and spaces for indentation. It's better to use one or the other consistently throughout your code.\n7. Avoid unnecessary comments: The `getName()` method in this code has a comment that says \"Returns the name of the customer.\" However, this comment is not necessary because the method name already provides this information. You can remove the comment without affecting the functionality of the code.",

The `||` operator is used to specify multiple conditions for the filter.\n\nFinally, we use the `collect()` method to collect the filtered orders into a new list.

        "content": "\nThis is an example of the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) in action. The `Order` class has a protected field `_warehouse` that represents the warehouse where the order will be fulfilled. The `PriorityOrder` class extends the `Order` class and adds a new field `_priorityPlan`.\n\nThe `getDaysToShip()` method in the `Order` class returns the number of days it takes to ship the order from the warehouse. In the `PriorityOrder` class, we override this method and return the number of days it takes to ship the order according to the priority plan.\n\nThe LSP states that a subclass must be substitutable for its base class. In other words, a `PriorityOrder` object can be used anywhere an `Order` object is expected. This means that we can pass a `PriorityOrder` object to any method that expects an `Order` object as a parameter, and the method will work correctly because it knows how to handle the additional field in the `PriorityOrder` class.\n\nIn this example, the `falsehood` delegate is not used, but it could be if we wanted to add more complex logic to the `getDaysToShip()` method. For example, we might want to check the priority plan and return a different value based on certain conditions. In that case, we would create a new delegate called `PriorityPlan` that implements the `IGetDaysToShip` interface, and then use that delegate in the `getDaysToShip()` method instead of the `Warehouse` delegate.",

This allows the `Stack` class to use the methods of the `List` interface that are not overridden by the `Stack` class.\n\nFor example, if you have a `Stack` object called `myStack`, you can call the `size()` method on it like this:\n```\nint size = myStack.size();\n```\nThis will call the `size()` method of the underlying `List` object that is stored in the `delegate` field, and return its result.\n\nNote that the `Stack` class does not need to override any methods of the `List` interface, because it simply delegates all calls to the underlying `List` object. This allows the `Stack` class to use the same methods as a `List`, but with the additional functionality of being able to push and pop elements from the top of the stack.",
