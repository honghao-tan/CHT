This ensures that the `Stack` class does not have to worry about the delegate being modified by other code.\n\nIn the constructor, we create a new instance of `ArrayList<String>` and assign it to the `delegate` field.

        "content": "\nHere is a possible implementation of the `createEmployee` method using subclasses:\n```\npublic class EmployeeFactory {\n    public static Employee createEmployee(String name, String type) {\n        if (type.equals(\"manager\")) {\n            return new Manager(name);\n        } else if (type.equals(\"engineer\")) {\n            return new Engineer(name);\n        } else if (type.equals(\"salesperson\")) {\n            return new Salesperson(name);\n        } else {\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Invalid employee type: \" + type);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThis implementation uses subclasses to create different types of employees, based on the `type` parameter. The `Manager`, `Engineer`, and `Salesperson` classes are all subclasses of the `Employee` class, which defines the common behavior for all employees. The `createEmployee` method creates an instance of the appropriate subclass based on the value of the `type` parameter.\n\nFor example, if you call `createEmployee(\"John Doe\", \"manager\")`, it will create a new instance of the `Manager` class with the name \"John Doe\". Similarly, if you call `createEmployee(\"Jane Smith\", \"engineer\")`, it will create a new instance of the `Engineer` class with the name \"Jane Smith\".\n\nThis implementation is more flexible and extensible than the previous one, as it allows for the creation of new types of employees without modifying the existing code. It also makes it easier to add new functionality to the `Employee` class, such as a `getSalary()` method that returns the salary for each type of employee.",

It works by splitting the input string into an array of words using whitespace as the delimiter, then iterating over each word and converting any numbers to spicspeak format. The output is stored in a `StringBuilder` and returned as a `String`.\n\nHere's an example usage of the `spicspeak` method:\n```\nString input = \"Hello 123 World!\";\nString output = spicspeak(input);\nSystem.out.println(output); // Output: \"Hello 246 369 502 World!\"\n```",
