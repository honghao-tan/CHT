For example, if you want to check whether a string is left-justified, you could use the following code:\n```\nif (string.getJustification() == X.LEFT) {\n    // do something\n}\n```\nThis code checks whether the `getJustification()` method of the `string` object returns the value `X.LEFT`, which is a constant defined in the class `X`.

Each subclass has its own implementation of the `getPlumage()` method that returns a specific value based on its type.\n\nFor example, the `EuropeanSwallow` subclass might return \"average\" for all instances, while the `AfricanSwallow` subclass might return \"tired\" if the number of coconuts is greater than 2. The `NorwegianBlueParrot` subclass might return \"scorched\" if the voltage is greater than 100, and \"beautiful\" otherwise.\n\nBy using polymorphism in this way, we can avoid code duplication and make our code more modular and flexible.",

However, in this case, the `PriorityOrder` class introduces a new field `_priorityPlan` that refers to a priority plan, and it overrides the `getDaysToShip()` method to return the number of days it takes for the order to be shipped from the warehouse according to the priority plan.\n\nThe LSP states that if a parent class is substitutable for one of its subclasses, then all references to the parent class should be able to refer to the subclass without breaking the program's correctness. In this case, the `PriorityOrder` class is substitutable for the `Order` class because it has the same properties and methods as the parent class, but it also introduces a new field that allows it to provide more specific information about the order.\n\nTherefore, the use of the delegate in the `PriorityOrder` class is necessary to ensure that all references to the `Order` class can refer to the `PriorityOrder` class without breaking the program's correctness.

The second line of code assigns the value `height * width` to the variable `temp`.\n\nHere's the step-by-step breakdown of what happens in each line:\n\n1. `int temp = 2 * (height + width);`\n\t* This line declares a new variable named `temp` and initializes it with the value `2 * (height + width)`. The `*` operator is used to perform multiplication, and the `+` operator is used to perform addition. The parentheses are used to group the operands together so that the expression is evaluated correctly.\n2. `System.out.println(temp);`\n\t* This line uses the `println()` method of the `System.out` object to print the value of the variable `temp` to the console. The `println()` method takes a single argument, which can be any object that implements the `toString()` method. In this case, the argument is an integer, so it will be printed as a string.\n3. `temp = height * width;`\n\t* This line assigns the value of `height * width` to the variable `temp`. The `*` operator is used to perform multiplication, and the `=` operator is used to assign the result to the variable.\n4. `System.out.println(temp);`\n\t* This line uses the `println()` method of the `System.out` object to print the value of the variable `temp` to the console. The `println()` method takes a single argument, which can be any object that implements the `toString()` method. In this case, the argument is an integer, so it will be printed as a string.\n\nSo, in summary, the first line declares and initializes a variable named `temp` with the value `2 * (height + width)`, while the second line assigns the value of `height * width` to the same variable. The third line prints the value of the variable `temp` to the console, and the fourth line prints the value of the variable `temp` again.",
