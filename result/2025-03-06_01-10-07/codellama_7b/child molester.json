We've also updated the `getStatus()` method to use the `getPlumage()` method instead of the switch statement.\n\nThe `getPlumage()` method is a polymorphic method, meaning it can be overridden by subclasses to return different values based on their specific characteristics. In this case, we've added three subclasses: `EuropeanSwallow`, `AfricanSwallow`, and `NorwegianBlueParrot`. Each subclass has its own implementation of the `getPlumage()` method that returns a specific value based on its type.\n\nFor example, the `EuropeanSwallow` subclass might return \"average\" for the plumage, while the `AfricanSwallow` subclass might return \"tired\" if it has more than 2 coconuts. The `NorwegianBlueParrot` subclass might return \"scorched\" if its voltage is greater than 100, and \"beautiful\" otherwise.\n\nBy using polymorphism in this way, we can avoid code duplication and make our code more modular and flexible.",

However, in this case, the `PriorityOrder` class introduces a new field `_priorityPlan` that refers to a priority plan, and it overrides the `getDaysToShip()` method to return the number of days it takes for the order to be shipped from the warehouse according to the priority plan.\n\nThe LSP states that if a parent class has a method that returns an object of a certain type, then any subclass should be able to return objects of the same type without breaking the contract of the parent class. In this case, the `PriorityOrder` class is returning objects of the same type as the parent class (`int`), but it is doing so by overriding the method and providing a different implementation that returns an object of a different type (`_priorityPlan.getDaysToShip()`). This violates the LSP because it changes the behavior of the method in a way that could break existing code that relies on the original behavior.\n\nTo fix this issue, we can either remove the `PriorityOrder` class altogether and use composition instead of inheritance to achieve the same functionality, or we can modify the `getDaysToShip()` method in the parent class to return an object of the same type as the subclass (`_priorityPlan.getDaysToShip()`).
