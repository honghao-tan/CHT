The method checks if the given name is equal to \"height\". If it is, then it sets the `height` field to the given value.\n3. The method does not return anything because it is a void method.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use this method:\n```\nRectangle r = new Rectangle();\nr.setDimension(\"height\", 5.0);\n```\nThis will set the height of the rectangle to 5.0.\n\nNote that this solution is more flexible than the previous one because it allows you to add more dimensions to the `Rectangle` class in the future without having to modify the existing code.",

In this case, we've defined three subclasses: `EuropeanSwallow`, `AfricanSwallow`, and `NorwegianBlueParrot`. Each subclass has its own implementation of the `getPlumage()` method that returns a specific value based on its type.\n\nFor example, the `EuropeanSwallow` subclass might return \"average\" for all instances, while the `AfricanSwallow` subclass might return \"tired\" if it has more than 2 coconuts and \"average\" otherwise. The `NorwegianBlueParrot` subclass might return \"scorched\" if its voltage is greater than 100 and \"beautiful\" otherwise.\n\nBy using polymorphism, we can avoid code duplication and make our code more modular and flexible.",

The first part is stored in the variable `orderData`, and the second part is stored in the variable `productDetails`.\n\nThe `split()` method returns an array of strings, where each element in the array corresponds to a substring in the original string. In this case, the first element in the array is the entire input string, and the second element is the substring that occurs after the first occurrence of the `-` character.\n\nThe code then uses the `get()` method to retrieve the price for the product from the `priceList` map, based on the name of the product (which is stored in the second part of the `orderData` array). The price is then multiplied by the quantity specified in the input string (which is stored in the first part of the `orderData` array), and the result is stored in the variable `orderPrice`.\n\nNote that the `get()` method returns an integer value, which is then converted to a string using the `toString()` method. This is necessary because the `priceList` map contains integer values, but the input string may contain non-integer quantities (e.g., \"2.5\" for a quantity of 2.5).",
