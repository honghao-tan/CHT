        "content": "\nHere is the updated code with subclasses for the different types of employees:\n```\npublic class EmployeeFactory {\n    public static Employee createEmployee(String name, String type) {\n        switch (type) {\n            case \"Manager\":\n                return new Manager(name);\n            case \"Salesperson\":\n                return new Salesperson(name);\n            case \"Developer\":\n                return new Developer(name);\n            default:\n                throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Invalid employee type\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code uses a `switch` statement to determine the type of employee based on the `type` parameter. It then creates an instance of the appropriate subclass and returns it.\n\nThe `Manager`, `Salesperson`, and `Developer` classes are defined as follows:\n```\npublic class Manager extends Employee {\n    public Manager(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Salesperson extends Employee {\n    public Salesperson(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Developer extends Employee {\n    public Developer(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n}\n```\nThese classes extend the `Employee` class and provide additional functionality for each type of employee. For example, the `Manager` class might have methods for managing a team or department, while the `Salesperson` class might have methods for making sales calls. The `Developer` class might have methods for writing code or debugging issues.\n\nThe `EmployeeFactory` class is responsible for creating instances of these subclasses based on the type of employee that is requested. It does this by using a `switch` statement to determine which subclass to create and then calling the appropriate constructor.\n\nThis design pattern allows you to create objects without having to specify the exact class that will be created, which can make your code more flexible and easier to maintain.",

The `sendBill()` method sends the bill to the customer.\n\nIn this modified code, we have separated the query (getting the total amount of outstanding invoices) from the modifier (sending the bill).

We then get the name and price of the product from the first element in the array, which is the product name followed by a hyphen and the quantity. We use the `priceList` to get the price of the product based on its name. Finally, we calculate the total cost of the order by multiplying the quantity by the price.",
