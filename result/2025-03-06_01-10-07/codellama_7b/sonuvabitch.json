This parameter represents the percentage of raise that you want to apply to the employee's salary. The function then uses the `multiply` method of the `BigDecimal` class to multiply the employee's current salary by the specified percentage, plus 1.\n\nFor example, if you call the `sonuvabitch` function with a parameter of 10, it will apply a 10% raise to the employee's salary. If you call the function with a parameter of 25, it will apply a 25% raise.\n\nYou can then use this new function in your code to apply raises to employees based on their performance or other factors. For example:\n```\nPerson employee = new Person();\nemployee.setSalary(BigDecimal.valueOf(50_000));\n\n// Apply a 10% raise to the employee's salary\nemployee.sonuvabitch(10);\n\nSystem.out.println(\"Employee's new salary: \" + employee.getSalary());\n```\nThis code will apply a 10% raise to the employee's salary and print out their new salary, which would be $55,000 in this example.",

It's better to use descriptive and meaningful names for your variables. In this case, you could use something like `area` or `perimeter`.\n2. You don't need to assign the value of `temp` to itself. The line `temp = height * width;` is unnecessary.\n3. It's better to use a consistent naming convention for your variables. In this case, you could use either camelCase (e.g. `heightWidth`) or PascalCase (e.g. `HeightWidth`).\n4. You don't need to use parentheses when multiplying two numbers together. For example, instead of writing `2 * (height + width)`, you can simply write `2 * height + 2 * width`.\n5. It's better to use a consistent indentation style throughout your code. In this case, you could use either spaces or tabs for indentation.\n6. You don't need to use `System.out.println()` multiple times to print the same value. Instead, you can simply print it once and then move on to the next line of code.\n7. It's better to use a consistent formatting style throughout your code. In this case, you could use either spaces or tabs for indentation, and make sure that there are no unnecessary blank lines in your code.\n8.
