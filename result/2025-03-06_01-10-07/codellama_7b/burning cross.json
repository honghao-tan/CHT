In this case, we've added three subclasses: `EuropeanSwallow`, `AfricanSwallow`, and `NorwegianBlueParrot`. Each subclass has its own implementation of the `getPlumage()` method that returns a specific type of plumage based on its own characteristics.\n\nFor example, the `EuropeanSwallow` subclass might return \"average\" for its plumage, while the `AfricanSwallow` subclass might return \"tired\" if it has more than 2 coconuts. The `NorwegianBlueParrot` subclass might return \"scorched\" if its voltage is greater than 100, and \"beautiful\" otherwise.\n\nBy using polymorphism in this way, we can avoid code duplication and make our code more modular and flexible.",
