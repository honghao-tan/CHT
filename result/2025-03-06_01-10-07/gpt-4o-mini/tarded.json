        "content": "To replace the primitive comparison with an object that has a method to compare, you can create a class named `Tarded` that encapsulates the comparison logic. Below is an example of how you can implement this:\n\n1. Create the `Tarded` class with a method to compare priorities.\n2. Use this class in your stream filter.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.List;\nimport java.util.stream.Collectors;\n\nclass Tarded {\n    private String priority;\n\n    public Tarded(String priority) {\n        this.priority = priority;\n    }\n\n    public boolean isHighOrRush() {\n        return \"high\".equals(priority) || \"rush\".equals(priority);\n    }\n}\n\n// Assuming Order is a class with a getPriority() method\nclass Order {\n    private String priority;\n\n    public Order(String priority) {\n        this.priority = priority;\n    }\n\n    public String getPriority() {\n        return priority;\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        List<Order> orders = List.of(\n            new Order(\"high\"),\n            new Order(\"low\"),\n            new Order(\"rush\"),\n            new Order(\"medium\")\n        );\n\n        List<Order> filteredOrders = orders.stream()\n            .filter(o -> new Tarded(o.getPriority()).isHighOrRush())\n            .collect(Collectors.toList());\n\n        // Output the filtered orders\n        filteredOrders.forEach(order -> System.out.println(order.getPriority()));\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Tarded Class**: This class has a constructor that takes a priority string and a method `isHighOrRush()` that checks if the priority is either \"high\" or \"rush\".\n2. **Order Class**: This is a simple representation of an order with a priority.\n3. **Stream Filtering**: In the stream, we create a new `Tarded` object for each order's priority and call the `isHighOrRush()` method to filter the orders.\n\nThis approach encapsulates the comparison logic within the `Tarded` class, making the code cleaner and more maintainable.",

For example:\n\n```java\nPriorityPlan priorityPlan = new PriorityPlan();\nTarded tarded = new Tarded(priorityPlan);\nint daysToShip = tarded.getDaysToShip();\n```\n\nThis way, you have effectively replaced the subclass with a delegate while maintaining the functionality.",

In this example, I've added basic stack operations like `push`, `pop`, `isEmpty`, and `size`.\n\n2. **Stack Class**: The `Stack` class now contains an instance of `Tarded` and delegates the stack operations to this instance. This way, `Stack` does not inherit from `List` anymore but instead uses `Tarded` as a delegate.\n\n3. **Method Delegation**: Each method in `Stack` calls the corresponding method in `Tarded`, effectively delegating the functionality.\n\nThis design allows you to maintain the functionality of a stack while using composition instead of inheritance.",

Let's assume we have different types of employees, such as `FullTimeEmployee`, `PartTimeEmployee`, and `ContractEmployee`. We will create these subclasses and modify the `createEmployee` method to instantiate the appropriate subclass based on the `type` parameter.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n### Step 1: Create Subclasses\n\nFirst, we define the subclasses for each type of employee:\n\n```java\npublic abstract class Employee {\n    protected String name;\n\n    public Employee(String name) {\n        this.name = name;\n    }\n\n    public abstract String getType();\n}\n\npublic class FullTimeEmployee extends Employee {\n    public FullTimeEmployee(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String getType() {\n        return \"Full-Time\";\n    }\n}\n\npublic class PartTimeEmployee extends Employee {\n    public PartTimeEmployee(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String getType() {\n        return \"Part-Time\";\n    }\n}\n\npublic class ContractEmployee extends Employee {\n    public ContractEmployee(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String getType() {\n        return \"Contract\";\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 2: Modify the `createEmployee` Method\n\nNow, we modify the `createEmployee` method to return the appropriate subclass based on the `type` parameter:\n\n```java\npublic class EmployeeFactory {\n    public Employee createEmployee(String name, String type) {\n        switch (type.toLowerCase()) {\n            case \"fulltime\":\n                return new FullTimeEmployee(name);\n            case \"parttime\":\n                return new PartTimeEmployee(name);\n            case \"contract\":\n                return new ContractEmployee(name);\n            default:\n                throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Invalid employee type: \" + type);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Usage Example\n\nYou can now use the `EmployeeFactory` to create employees:\n\n```java\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        EmployeeFactory factory = new EmployeeFactory();\n\n        Employee emp1 = factory.createEmployee(\"Alice\", \"fulltime\");\n        Employee emp2 = factory.createEmployee(\"Bob\", \"parttime\");\n        Employee emp3 = factory.createEmployee(\"Charlie\", \"contract\");\n\n        System.out.println(emp1.getType()); // Output: Full-Time\n        System.out.println(emp2.getType()); // Output: Part-Time\n        System.out.println(emp3.getType()); // Output: Contract\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Summary\n\nIn this implementation, we replaced the type code with subclasses, allowing for better organization and extensibility of the employee types.
