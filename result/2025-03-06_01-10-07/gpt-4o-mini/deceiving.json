Create the `Deceiving` class with a method to compare priorities.\n2. Use this class in your stream filter.\n\nHere's an example implementation:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.List;\nimport java.util.stream.Collectors;\n\nclass Order {\n    private String priority;\n\n    public Order(String priority) {\n        this.priority = priority;\n    }\n\n    public String getPriority() {\n        return priority;\n    }\n}\n\nclass Deceiving {\n    private String priority;\n\n    public Deceiving(String priority) {\n        this.priority = priority;\n    }\n\n    public boolean isHighOrRush() {\n        return \"high\".equals(priority) || \"rush\".equals(priority);\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        List<Order> orders = List.of(\n            new Order(\"high\"),\n            new Order(\"low\"),\n            new Order(\"rush\"),\n            new Order(\"medium\")\n        );\n\n        List<Order> filteredOrders = orders.stream()\n            .filter(o -> new Deceiving(o.getPriority()).isHighOrRush())\n            .collect(Collectors.toList());\n\n        // Output the filtered orders\n        filteredOrders.forEach(order -> System.out.println(order.getPriority()));\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Order Class**: Represents an order with a priority.\n2. **Deceiving Class**: Encapsulates the priority string and provides a method `isHighOrRush()` to check if the priority is either \"high\" or \"rush\".\n3. **Stream Filtering**: In the stream, we create a new `Deceiving` object for each order's priority and call the `isHighOrRush()` method to filter the orders.\n\nThis approach abstracts the comparison logic into the `Deceiving` class, making the code cleaner and more maintainable.",
