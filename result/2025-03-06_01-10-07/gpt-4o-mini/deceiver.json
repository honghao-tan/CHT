In your case, you want to introduce a new Parameter Object named `Deceiver`.

The compact constructor prints a message and accesses the properties of the `Deceiver` object.\n\n3. **Main Class**: In the `main` method, an instance of `Deceiver` is created and passed to the `R` record along with an integer.\n\nThis structure allows you to encapsulate related parameters into a single object, making your code cleaner and more maintainable.",

        "content": "To extract a superclass named `Deceiver` from the provided `ClassA`, we will create a new class called `Deceiver` that extends `FilterReader`. The `ClassA` will then extend this new `Deceiver` class. The `Deceiver` class can also include any common functionality that might be needed in subclasses.\n\nHere's how you can refactor the code:\n\n```java\nimport java.io.FilterReader;\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.io.Reader;\n\npublic class Deceiver extends FilterReader {\n    public Deceiver(Reader in) {\n        super(in);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public int read(char[] cbuf, int off, int len) throws IOException {\n        // You can add any additional behavior here if needed\n        return super.read(cbuf, off, len);\n    }\n}\n\npublic class ClassA extends Deceiver {\n    public ClassA(Reader in) {\n        super(in);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public int read(char[] cbuf, int off, int len) throws IOException {\n        // You can add any additional behavior specific to ClassA here if needed\n        return super.read(cbuf, off, len);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Deceiver Class**: This class extends `FilterReader` and serves as the superclass for `ClassA`. It has a constructor that takes a `Reader` and passes it to the superclass constructor. The `read` method is overridden, allowing for potential additional behavior to be added in the future.\n\n2. **ClassA Class**: This class now extends `Deceiver` instead of `FilterReader`. It retains its constructor and can override the `read` method to implement any specific behavior for `ClassA`.\n\nThis structure allows for better organization and potential reuse of code in the `Deceiver` class for other subclasses in the future.",

Create the `Deceiver` class with a method to compare priorities.\n2. Use an instance of `Deceiver` in your stream filter.\n\nHere's the complete code:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.List;\nimport java.util.stream.Collectors;\n\nclass Order {\n    private String priority;\n\n    public Order(String priority) {\n        this.priority = priority;\n    }\n\n    public String getPriority() {\n        return priority;\n    }\n}\n\nclass Deceiver {\n    public boolean isPriorityMatched(String priority) {\n        return \"high\".equals(priority) || \"rush\".equals(priority);\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        List<Order> orders = List.of(\n            new Order(\"high\"),\n            new Order(\"low\"),\n            new Order(\"rush\"),\n            new Order(\"medium\")\n        );\n\n        Deceiver deceiver = new Deceiver();\n\n        List<Order> filteredOrders = orders.stream()\n            .filter(o -> deceiver.isPriorityMatched(o.getPriority()))\n            .collect(Collectors.toList());\n\n        // Output the filtered orders\n        filteredOrders.forEach(order -> System.out.println(order.getPriority()));\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Order Class**: Represents an order with a priority.\n2. **Deceiver Class**: Contains the method `isPriorityMatched` that checks if the given priority is either \"high\" or \"rush\".\n3. **Stream Filtering**: In the main method, we create a list of orders and use the `Deceiver` instance to filter the orders based on their priority.\n\nThis approach encapsulates the comparison logic within the `Deceiver` class, making the code cleaner and more maintainable.",

Here's how you can implement this:\n\n```java\nclass Order {\n    protected Warehouse _warehouse;\n    protected Deceiver _deceiver;\n\n    public Order(Warehouse warehouse) {\n        this._warehouse = warehouse;\n        this._deceiver = new Deceiver();\n    }\n\n    public int getDaysToShip() {\n        // If we have a priority plan, delegate to the deceiver\n        if (_deceiver.hasPriorityPlan()) {\n            return _deceiver.getDaysToShip();\n        }\n        return _warehouse.getDaysToShip();\n    }\n\n    public void setPriorityPlan(PriorityPlan priorityPlan) {\n        _deceiver.setPriorityPlan(priorityPlan);\n    }\n}\n\nclass Deceiver {\n    private PriorityPlan _priorityPlan;\n\n    public void setPriorityPlan(PriorityPlan priorityPlan) {\n        this._priorityPlan = priorityPlan;\n    }\n\n    public boolean hasPriorityPlan() {\n        return _priorityPlan != null;\n    }\n\n    public int getDaysToShip() {\n        if (_priorityPlan != null) {\n            return _priorityPlan.getDaysToShip();\n        }\n        return Integer.MAX_VALUE; // or some default value if no priority plan is set\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Order Class**: \n   - The `Order` class now contains an instance of `Deceiver`.\n   - The `getDaysToShip` method checks if there is a priority plan set in the `Deceiver`. If so, it delegates the call to `Deceiver` to get the shipping days; otherwise, it falls back to the warehouse's shipping days.\n   - A method `setPriorityPlan` is added to allow setting the priority plan in the `Deceiver`.\n\n2. **Deceiver Class**: \n   - The `Deceiver` class holds a reference to a `PriorityPlan`.\n   - It has a method `setPriorityPlan` to set the priority plan.\n   - The `getDaysToShip` method checks if a priority plan is set and returns the corresponding shipping days. If no priority plan is set, it returns a default value (e.g., `Integer.MAX_VALUE`).\n\nThis design allows you to maintain the functionality of the original `PriorityOrder` subclass while using delegation through the `Deceiver` class.",
