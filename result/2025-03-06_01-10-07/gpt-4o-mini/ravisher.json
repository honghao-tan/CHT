Below is an example of how you might implement the `Ravisher` class, which could have its own specific behavior while still utilizing the `Customer` class.\n\n### Option 1: Extending the Customer Class\n\nIf `Ravisher` is a specialized type of `Customer`, you can extend the `Customer` class:\n\n```java\npublic class Ravisher extends Customer {\n    public Ravisher(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String getName() {\n        // You can add special behavior for Ravisher here\n        // For example, if the name is \"unknown\", return a different string\n        if (\"unknown\".equals(super.getName())) {\n            return \"mysterious occupant\";\n        }\n        return super.getName();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Option 2: Composition\n\nIf `Ravisher` should not be a type of `Customer`, you can create it as a separate class that uses `Customer`:\n\n```java\npublic class Ravisher {\n    private Customer customer;\n\n    public Ravisher(String name) {\n        this.customer = new Customer(name);\n    }\n\n    public String getName() {\n        // You can add special behavior for Ravisher here\n        if (\"unknown\".equals(customer.getName())) {\n            return \"mysterious occupant\";\n        }\n        return customer.getName();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Usage Example\n\nHere’s how you might use the `Ravisher` class in your code:\n\n```java\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Customer customer1 = new Customer(\"John Doe\");\n        System.out.println(customer1.getName()); // Output: John Doe\n\n        Customer customer2 = new Customer(\"unknown\");\n        System.out.println(customer2.getName()); // Output: occupant\n\n        Ravisher ravisher1 = new Ravisher(\"unknown\");\n        System.out.println(ravisher1.getName()); // Output: mysterious occupant\n\n        Ravisher ravisher2 = new Ravisher(\"Jane Doe\");\n        System.out.println(ravisher2.getName()); // Output: Jane Doe\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this implementation, the `Ravisher` class can provide additional behavior while still leveraging the existing functionality of the `Customer` class.

It implements `getStatus()` to return \"tired\" or \"average\" based on the number of coconuts.\n- **NorwegianBlueParrot Class**: This class extends `Bird` and takes `voltage` as a parameter. It implements `getStatus()` to return \"scorched\" or \"beautiful\" based on the voltage.\n- **Main Class**: This is where we create instances of each bird type and call their `getStatus()` methods to demonstrate polymorphism.\n\nThis design eliminates the need for conditionals and makes it easier to add new bird types in the future by simply creating new subclasses.",

This class will have a method to check if an order's priority matches the desired criteria. Here's how you can implement this:\n\n1. Create the `Ravisher` class with a method to compare priorities.\n2. Use an instance of `Ravisher` in your stream filter.\n\nHere's the complete code:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.List;\nimport java.util.stream.Collectors;\n\nclass Order {\n    private String priority;\n\n    public Order(String priority) {\n        this.priority = priority;\n    }\n\n    public String getPriority() {\n        return priority;\n    }\n}\n\nclass Ravisher {\n    public boolean isHighOrRush(String priority) {\n        return \"high\".equals(priority) || \"rush\".equals(priority);\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        List<Order> orders = List.of(\n            new Order(\"high\"),\n            new Order(\"low\"),\n            new Order(\"rush\"),\n            new Order(\"medium\")\n        );\n\n        Ravisher ravisher = new Ravisher();\n\n        List<Order> filteredOrders = orders.stream()\n            .filter(o -> ravisher.isHighOrRush(o.getPriority()))\n            .collect(Collectors.toList());\n\n        // Output the filtered orders\n        filteredOrders.forEach(order -> System.out.println(order.getPriority()));\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Order Class**: Represents an order with a priority.\n2. **Ravisher Class**: Contains the method `isHighOrRush` that checks if the given priority is either \"high\" or \"rush\".\n3. **Stream Filtering**: In the main method, we create a list of orders and use the `Ravisher` instance to filter the orders based on their priority.\n\nThis approach encapsulates the comparison logic within the `Ravisher` class, making the code cleaner and more maintainable.",

It can still get the standard shipping days from the `Warehouse` and has a new method `getPriorityDaysToShip()` to get the shipping days from the `Ravisher`.\n\n2. **Ravisher Class**: The `Ravisher` class encapsulates the logic for priority shipping. It has a `PriorityPlan` instance and provides a method to get the days to ship based on that plan.\n\n3. **Warehouse and PriorityPlan Classes**: These classes are assumed to be defined elsewhere, providing the necessary methods to get shipping days.\n\nThis design allows you to maintain the original functionality while replacing the subclass with a delegate, promoting better separation of concerns.",

It manages an array of elements and provides methods to add elements, retrieve elements, and check the size.\n\n2. **Stack Class**: Instead of extending `List`, the `Stack` class now has an instance of `Ravisher`. It delegates the operations to the `Ravisher` instance. For example, the `push` method calls `add` on the `Ravisher`, and the `pop` method retrieves the last element.\n\nThis design allows for better separation of concerns and adheres to the composition over inheritance principle.",
