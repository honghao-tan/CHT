Then, we will modify `ClassA` to extend `SpicSpeak` instead. Here’s how you can do it:\n\n1. Create the `SpicSpeak` class that extends `FilterReader`.\n2. Move the constructor and the `read` method from `ClassA` to `SpicSpeak`.\n3. Modify `ClassA` to extend `SpicSpeak`.\n\nHere’s the refactored code:\n\n```java\nimport java.io.FilterReader;\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.io.Reader;\n\npublic class SpicSpeak extends FilterReader {\n  public SpicSpeak(Reader in) {   \n    super(in);\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public int read(char[] cbuf, int off, int len) throws IOException {\n    return super.read(cbuf, off, len);\n  }\n}\n\npublic class ClassA extends SpicSpeak {\n  public ClassA(Reader in) {   \n    super(in);\n  }\n\n  // Additional functionality specific to ClassA can be added here\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **SpicSpeak Class**: This new class extends `FilterReader` and contains the constructor and the overridden `read` method. This allows any subclass of `SpicSpeak` to inherit this functionality.\n- **ClassA**: Now extends `SpicSpeak`, which means it inherits the constructor and the `read` method. You can add any additional functionality specific to `ClassA` in this class.\n\nThis structure promotes code reuse and adheres to the principles of object-oriented design.",

It overrides the `getName()` method to provide a different output when the name is \"unknown\". In this case, it returns \"spic occupant\" instead of just \"occupant\".\n\n### Usage Example:\nYou can create instances of both `Customer` and `SpicSpeak` to see how they behave:\n\n```java\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Customer customer1 = new Customer(\"John\");\n        Customer customer2 = new Customer(\"unknown\");\n        \n        SpicSpeak spicCustomer1 = new SpicSpeak(\"unknown\");\n        SpicSpeak spicCustomer2 = new SpicSpeak(\"Alice\");\n\n        System.out.println(customer1.getName()); // Output: John\n        System.out.println(customer2.getName()); // Output: occupant\n        System.out.println(spicCustomer1.getName()); // Output: spic occupant\n        System.out.println(spicCustomer2.getName()); // Output: Alice\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation allows you to handle the special case in the `SpicSpeak` class while maintaining the original functionality of the `Customer` class.",
