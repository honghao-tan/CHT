Then, we will modify `ClassA` to extend this new superclass instead. Here’s how you can do it:\n\n1. Create the `EatingDisorderPromotion` class that extends `FilterReader`.\n2. Move the constructor and the `read` method from `ClassA` to `EatingDisorderPromotion`.\n3. Modify `ClassA` to extend `EatingDisorderPromotion`.\n\nHere’s the refactored code:\n\n```java\nimport java.io.FilterReader;\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.io.Reader;\n\npublic class EatingDisorderPromotion extends FilterReader {\n  \n  public EatingDisorderPromotion(Reader in) {   \n    super(in);\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public int read(char[] cbuf, int off, int len) throws IOException {\n    return super.read(cbuf, off, len);\n  }\n}\n\npublic class ClassA extends EatingDisorderPromotion {\n  \n  public ClassA(Reader in) {   \n    super(in);\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public int read(char[] cbuf, int off, int len) throws IOException {\n    return super.read(cbuf, off, len);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **EatingDisorderPromotion Class**: This class now serves as the superclass that extends `FilterReader`. It contains the constructor and the overridden `read` method.\n- **ClassA**: This class now extends `EatingDisorderPromotion` and inherits its functionality. It can still override the `read` method if needed, but currently, it simply calls the superclass implementation.\n\nThis structure allows for better code organization and potential reuse of the `EatingDisorderPromotion` class in other subclasses.",
