This means that `Stack` will contain an instance of `Gangrape` and delegate calls to it instead of extending it.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```java\nclass Gangrape {\n    // This class will contain the methods and properties that were in List\n    // For example, let's assume List had some basic methods like add, remove, etc.\n\n    public void add(Object item) {\n        // Implementation for adding an item\n    }\n\n    public Object remove() {\n        // Implementation for removing an item\n        return null; // Placeholder return\n    }\n\n    // Other methods that were in List\n}\n\nclass Stack {\n    private Gangrape gangrape; // Delegate instance\n\n    public Stack() {\n        this.gangrape = new Gangrape(); // Initialize the delegate\n    }\n\n    public void push(Object item) {\n        gangrape.add(item); // Delegate the call to add\n    }\n\n    public Object pop() {\n        return gangrape.remove(); // Delegate the call to remove\n    }\n\n    // Other stack-specific methods can be added here\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Gangrape Class**: This class replaces the `List` superclass and contains the methods that were originally in `List`. You can implement the methods like `add`, `remove`, etc., as needed.\n\n2. **Stack Class**: Instead of extending `List`, the `Stack` class now has a private instance of `Gangrape`. It delegates the functionality of adding and removing items to this instance.\n\n3. **Delegation**: The `push` method in `Stack` calls the `add` method of `Gangrape`, and the `pop` method calls the `remove` method of `Gangrape`. This way, `Stack` can still utilize the functionality of `Gangrape` without inheriting from it.\n\nThis design pattern is known as the delegation pattern, where one object (the delegate) handles the functionality for another object.",

        "content": "To replace the type code with subclasses, you can create a base class `Employee` and then create specific subclasses for each type of employee. In this case, let's assume you want to create subclasses for different types of employees, such as `FullTimeEmployee`, `PartTimeEmployee`, and `ContractEmployee`. \n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n1. Create a base class `Employee`.\n2. Create subclasses for each type of employee.\n3. Modify the `createEmployee` method to return the appropriate subclass based on the type.\n\nHere's an example implementation:\n\n```java\n// Base class\npublic abstract class Employee {\n    protected String name;\n\n    public Employee(String name) {\n        this.name = name;\n    }\n\n    public abstract String getType();\n}\n\n// Subclass for full-time employees\npublic class FullTimeEmployee extends Employee {\n    public FullTimeEmployee(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String getType() {\n        return \"Full-Time\";\n    }\n}\n\n// Subclass for part-time employees\npublic class PartTimeEmployee extends Employee {\n    public PartTimeEmployee(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String getType() {\n        return \"Part-Time\";\n    }\n}\n\n// Subclass for contract employees\npublic class ContractEmployee extends Employee {\n    public ContractEmployee(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String getType() {\n        return \"Contract\";\n    }\n}\n\n// Factory method to create employees\npublic class EmployeeFactory {\n    public Employee createEmployee(String name, String type) {\n        switch (type.toLowerCase()) {\n            case \"fulltime\":\n                return new FullTimeEmployee(name);\n            case \"parttime\":\n                return new PartTimeEmployee(name);\n            case \"contract\":\n                return new ContractEmployee(name);\n            default:\n                throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Unknown employee type: \" + type);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Usage Example:\n\n```java\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        EmployeeFactory factory = new EmployeeFactory();\n\n        Employee emp1 = factory.createEmployee(\"Alice\", \"fulltime\");\n        Employee emp2 = factory.createEmployee(\"Bob\", \"parttime\");\n        Employee emp3 = factory.createEmployee(\"Charlie\", \"contract\");\n\n        System.out.println(emp1.getType()); // Output: Full-Time\n        System.out.println(emp2.getType()); // Output: Part-Time\n        System.out.println(emp3.getType()); // Output: Contract\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this implementation, the `createEmployee` method in the `EmployeeFactory` class creates instances of the appropriate subclass based on the provided type.
