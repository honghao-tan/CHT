You can add more fields to this record if needed.\n\n2. **Record `R`**: The existing record `R` is modified to include an instance of the `Derogatory` record as a second parameter. This allows you to pass a `Derogatory` object when creating an instance of `R`.\n\n3. **Compact Constructor**: The compact constructor for `R` is retained, and it will print \"Compact Constructor\" when an instance of `R` is created.\n\n4. **Derogatory Constructor**: The constructor for `Derogatory` will print \"Derogatory Constructor\" when an instance of `Derogatory` is created.\n\n### Example Usage:\nHere's how you might create instances of these records:\n\n```java\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Derogatory derogatory = new Derogatory(\"This is a derogatory message\");\n        R r = new R(10, derogatory);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, you will see the following output:\n```\nDerogatory Constructor\nCompact Constructor\n```\n\nThis demonstrates the creation of both the `Derogatory` and `R` records, showcasing how the Parameter Object pattern can be applied.",

If the name is \"unknown\", it returns \"occupant\".\n\n2. **DerogatoryCustomer Class**: This new class extends the `Customer` class. It overrides the `getName` method to check for a specific derogatory name (in this case, \"derogatoryName\"). If it encounters this name, it returns a different string (e.g., \"not applicable\"). Otherwise, it calls the superclass's `getName` method to return the normal behavior.\n\n### Usage Example:\n```java\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Customer customer1 = new Customer(\"John Doe\");\n        System.out.println(customer1.getName()); // Output: John Doe\n\n        Customer customer2 = new Customer(\"unknown\");\n        System.out.println(customer2.getName()); // Output: occupant\n\n        DerogatoryCustomer derogatoryCustomer = new DerogatoryCustomer(\"derogatoryName\");\n        System.out.println(derogatoryCustomer.getName()); // Output: not applicable\n\n        DerogatoryCustomer normalCustomer = new DerogatoryCustomer(\"Jane Doe\");\n        System.out.println(normalCustomer.getName()); // Output: Jane Doe\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation allows you to handle derogatory names specifically while still maintaining the functionality of the original `Customer` class.

We define an `Order` class with a `getPriority` method.\n2. We create a `PriorityComparator` class with a method `isPriorityDerogatory` that checks if the order's priority is \"high\" or \"rush\".\n3. We use this method in the stream filter to get the filtered list of orders.\n\nThis approach encapsulates the comparison logic within an object, as requested.",
