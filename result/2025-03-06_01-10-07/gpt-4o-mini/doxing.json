This record has three fields: `name`, `address`, and `email`, all of which are of type `String`.\n- **Compact Constructor**: The compact constructor is defined within the record body. It prints a message to the console whenever a new instance of `Doxing` is created.\n- **SuppressWarnings Annotation**: The `@SuppressWarnings(\"preview\")` annotation is used to suppress warnings related to preview features in Java, which may be relevant if you're using a preview feature of the language.\n\n### Usage Example:\nYou can create an instance of the `Doxing` record like this:\n\n```java\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Doxing doxingInfo = new Doxing(\"John Doe\", \"123 Main St\", \"john.doe@example.com\");\n        System.out.println(doxingInfo);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis will output:\n```\nCompact Constructor for Doxing\nDoxing[name=John Doe, address=123 Main St, email=john.doe@example.com]\n```\n\nThis example demonstrates how to create a new Parameter Object in Java using records, encapsulating multiple related parameters into a single cohesive unit.",

The `ClassA` will then extend this new `Doxing` class. Here’s how you can do it:\n\n1. Create the `Doxing` class that extends `FilterReader`.\n2. Move the constructor and any relevant methods from `ClassA` to `Doxing`.\n3. Update `ClassA` to extend `Doxing`.\n\nHere’s the refactored code:\n\n```java\nimport java.io.FilterReader;\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.io.Reader;\n\n// Superclass named Doxing\npublic class Doxing extends FilterReader {\n    public Doxing(Reader in) {\n        super(in);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public int read(char[] cbuf, int off, int len) throws IOException {\n        return super.read(cbuf, off, len);\n    }\n}\n\n// ClassA now extends Doxing\npublic class ClassA extends Doxing {\n    public ClassA(Reader in) {\n        super(in);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public int read(char[] cbuf, int off, int len) throws IOException {\n        return super.read(cbuf, off, len);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The `Doxing` class is created as a superclass that extends `FilterReader`.\n- The constructor of `Doxing` takes a `Reader` as a parameter and passes it to the superclass constructor.\n- The `read` method is overridden in `Doxing`, but it simply calls the superclass's `read` method.\n- `ClassA` now extends `Doxing`, and its constructor calls the `Doxing` constructor.\n- The `read` method in `ClassA` remains the same, but it can be customized further if needed. \n\nThis structure allows for better code organization and potential reuse of the `Doxing` class in other subclasses.",

Below is an example implementation of the `Doxing` class that extends the functionality of the `Customer` class.\n\n```java\npublic class Customer {\n    private String name;\n\n    public Customer(String name) {\n        this.name = name;\n    }\n\n    public String getName() {\n        if (\"unknown\".equals(name)) {\n            return \"occupant\";\n        }\n        return name;\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Doxing {\n    private Customer customer;\n\n    public Doxing(Customer customer) {\n        this.customer = customer;\n    }\n\n    public String getSafeName() {\n        String name = customer.getName();\n        // Here we can add additional logic to handle doxing cases\n        if (isDoxingRisk(name)) {\n            return \"protected\";\n        }\n        return name;\n    }\n\n    private boolean isDoxingRisk(String name) {\n        // Implement logic to determine if the name poses a doxing risk\n        // For example, we could check against a list of known sensitive names\n        // or apply certain heuristics.

It has a constructor to initialize the `name` and a method `getName()` that returns \"occupant\" if the name is \"unknown\".\n\n2. **Doxing Class**:\n   - **Constructor**: Takes a `Customer` object as a parameter.\n   - **getSafeName() Method**: This method retrieves the name from the `Customer` object and checks if it poses a doxing risk using the `isDoxingRisk()` method. If it does, it returns \"protected\"; otherwise, it returns the actual name.\n   - **isDoxingRisk() Method**: This is a placeholder method where you can implement logic to determine if the name poses a risk of doxing. In this example, it simply checks if the name is not \"occupant\".\n\n### Usage Example:\n```java\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Customer customer1 = new Customer(\"unknown\");\n        Doxing doxing1 = new Doxing(customer1);\n        System.out.println(doxing1.getSafeName()); // Output: occupant\n\n        Customer customer2 = new Customer(\"John Doe\");\n        Doxing doxing2 = new Doxing(customer2);\n        System.out.println(doxing2.getSafeName()); // Output: John Doe\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation provides a basic structure for handling doxing-related concerns while maintaining the original functionality of the `Customer` class.

It checks if the `Doxing` object is not null and delegates the call to `getDaysToShip()` to it. If `Doxing` is null, it falls back to using the `_warehouse`.\n\n2. **Doxing Class**: The `Doxing` class encapsulates the logic for priority shipping. It holds a reference to a `PriorityPlan` and provides a method to get the days to ship based on that plan.\n\n3. **Constructor**: The `Order` constructor takes both a `Warehouse` and a `Doxing` object, allowing for flexible instantiation.\n\nThis design allows you to easily switch between standard and priority shipping without needing to create subclasses, adhering to the delegation pattern.",
