The `Noose` class can represent a specific type of customer, perhaps one that has a special designation or behavior.\n\nHere’s an example implementation of the `Noose` class:\n\n```java\npublic class Noose extends Customer {\n    public Noose() {\n        super(\"unknown\"); // Initialize with \"unknown\" to trigger the special case\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String getName() {\n        // You can customize the behavior further if needed\n        return \"noose\"; // Return a specific name for Noose instances\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Inheritance**: The `Noose` class extends the `Customer` class, which allows it to inherit the properties and methods of `Customer`.\n2. **Constructor**: The constructor of `Noose` calls the superclass constructor with the name \"unknown\". This ensures that if you were to call `getName()` on a `Noose` instance, it would initially return \"occupant\" unless overridden.\n3. **Overriding `getName()`**: The `getName()` method is overridden to return \"noose\", which provides a specific behavior for instances of the `Noose` class.\n\n### Usage Example:\nHere’s how you might use the `Noose` class in your application:\n\n```java\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Customer customer1 = new Customer(\"John Doe\");\n        System.out.println(customer1.getName()); // Output: John Doe\n\n        Customer nooseCustomer = new Noose();\n        System.out.println(nooseCustomer.getName()); // Output: noose\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation allows you to handle the special case of a customer named \"unknown\" in a more structured way by creating a dedicated class for it.",

        "content": "To replace the primitive comparison with an object that has a method to compare, you can create a class named `Noose` that encapsulates the comparison logic. Below is an example of how you can implement this:\n\n1. Create the `Noose` class with a method to compare priorities.\n2. Use this class in your stream filtering.\n\nHere's how you can implement it:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.List;\nimport java.util.stream.Collectors;\n\nclass Order {\n    private String priority;\n\n    public Order(String priority) {\n        this.priority = priority;\n    }\n\n    public String getPriority() {\n        return priority;\n    }\n}\n\nclass Noose {\n    private String[] validPriorities;\n\n    public Noose(String... validPriorities) {\n        this.validPriorities = validPriorities;\n    }\n\n    public boolean compare(String priority) {\n        for (String validPriority : validPriorities) {\n            if (validPriority.equals(priority)) {\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        List<Order> orders = List.of(\n            new Order(\"high\"),\n            new Order(\"low\"),\n            new Order(\"rush\"),\n            new Order(\"medium\")\n        );\n\n        Noose noose = new Noose(\"high\", \"rush\");\n\n        List<Order> filteredOrders = orders.stream()\n            .filter(o -> noose.compare(o.getPriority()))\n            .collect(Collectors.toList());\n\n        // Output the filtered orders\n        filteredOrders.forEach(order -> System.out.println(order.getPriority()));\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Order Class**: Represents an order with a priority.\n2. **Noose Class**: Contains an array of valid priorities and a method `compare` that checks if a given priority matches any of the valid priorities.\n3. **Filtering Logic**: In the stream, instead of using primitive comparisons, we call `noose.compare(o.getPriority())` to determine if the order's priority is valid.\n\nThis approach encapsulates the comparison logic within the `Noose` class, making the code cleaner and more maintainable.",

If no priority plan is set, it returns a default value (e.g., `Integer.MAX_VALUE`).\n\nThis design allows you to maintain the functionality of the original `PriorityOrder` subclass while using delegation instead.",

It manages an array of elements and provides methods to add, get, and manage the size of the collection.\n\n2. **Stack Class**: Instead of extending `List`, the `Stack` class now contains an instance of `Noose`. It delegates the operations to the `Noose` instance. For example, the `push` method calls `add` on the `Noose` instance, and the `pop` method retrieves the last element.\n\n3. **Encapsulation**: The `Stack` class encapsulates the `Noose` instance, allowing it to manage its own state while relying on `Noose` for the underlying data structure.\n\nThis design adheres to the delegation pattern, where `Stack` delegates its responsibilities to `Noose` instead of inheriting from it.",

Create subclasses for each type of employee.\n2. Modify the `createEmployee` method to instantiate the appropriate subclass based on the `type` parameter.\n\nHere's an example implementation:\n\n```java\n// Base class\npublic abstract class Employee {\n    protected String name;\n\n    public Employee(String name) {\n        this.name = name;\n    }\n\n    public abstract String getType();\n}\n\n// Subclass for full-time employees\npublic class FullTimeEmployee extends Employee {\n    public FullTimeEmployee(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String getType() {\n        return \"Full-Time\";\n    }\n}\n\n// Subclass for part-time employees\npublic class PartTimeEmployee extends Employee {\n    public PartTimeEmployee(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String getType() {\n        return \"Part-Time\";\n    }\n}\n\n// Subclass for contract employees\npublic class ContractEmployee extends Employee {\n    public ContractEmployee(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String getType() {\n        return \"Contract\";\n    }\n}\n\n// Factory method to create employees\npublic class EmployeeFactory {\n    public Employee createEmployee(String name, String type) {\n        switch (type.toLowerCase()) {\n            case \"fulltime\":\n                return new FullTimeEmployee(name);\n            case \"parttime\":\n                return new PartTimeEmployee(name);\n            case \"contract\":\n                return new ContractEmployee(name);\n            default:\n                throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Unknown employee type: \" + type);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Base Class (`Employee`)**: This is an abstract class that defines the common properties and methods for all employee types.\n2. **Subclasses**: Each subclass (`FullTimeEmployee`, `PartTimeEmployee`, `ContractEmployee`) extends the `Employee` class and provides its own implementation of the `getType` method.\n3. **Factory Method**: The `EmployeeFactory` class contains the `createEmployee` method, which uses a switch statement to determine which subclass to instantiate based on the `type` parameter.\n\n### Usage:\nYou can now create employees like this:\n\n```java\nEmployeeFactory factory = new EmployeeFactory();\nEmployee emp1 = factory.createEmployee(\"Alice\", \"fulltime\");\nEmployee emp2 = factory.createEmployee(\"Bob\", \"parttime\");\nEmployee emp3 = factory.createEmployee(\"Charlie\", \"contract\");\n```\n\nThis approach eliminates the type code and makes the code more maintainable and extensible.",
