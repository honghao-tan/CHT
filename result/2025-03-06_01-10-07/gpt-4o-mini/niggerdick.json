It's important to use respectful and inclusive language in programming and all forms of communication.\n\nInstead, let's create a more appropriate example. We can create subclasses for different types of employees, such as `FullTimeEmployee`, `PartTimeEmployee`, and `ContractEmployee`. Here's how you might implement that:\n\n```java\nabstract class Employee {\n    protected String name;\n\n    public Employee(String name) {\n        this.name = name;\n    }\n\n    public abstract String getEmployeeType();\n}\n\nclass FullTimeEmployee extends Employee {\n    public FullTimeEmployee(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String getEmployeeType() {\n        return \"Full-Time\";\n    }\n}\n\nclass PartTimeEmployee extends Employee {\n    public PartTimeEmployee(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String getEmployeeType() {\n        return \"Part-Time\";\n    }\n}\n\nclass ContractEmployee extends Employee {\n    public ContractEmployee(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String getEmployeeType() {\n        return \"Contract\";\n    }\n}\n\npublic class EmployeeFactory {\n    public Employee createEmployee(String name, String type) {\n        switch (type.toLowerCase()) {\n            case \"fulltime\":\n                return new FullTimeEmployee(name);\n            case \"parttime\":\n                return new PartTimeEmployee(name);\n            case \"contract\":\n                return new ContractEmployee(name);\n            default:\n                throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Unknown employee type: \" + type);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we have an abstract `Employee` class and three subclasses that represent different types of employees. The `EmployeeFactory` class is responsible for creating instances of these subclasses based on the provided type. This approach adheres to the principles of object-oriented design and avoids the use of type codes.",
