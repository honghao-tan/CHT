The separation of concerns in object-oriented programming allows for better code organization, readability, and maintainability. \n\nHowever, if you want to separate the query from the modifier, you can create two different methods: one for getting the total outstanding amount and another for sending a bill. Here's how you could do it:\n\n```java\npublic double getTotalOutstanding() {\n    double result = 0;\n    for (Invoice each : customer.getInvoices()) {\n        result += each.getAmount();\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n\npublic void sendBill() {\n    // Code to send bill goes here\n}\n```\n\nThen, you can call `sendBill` method in the `getTotalOutstandingAndSendBill` method:\n\n```java\npublic double getTotalOutstandingAndSendBill()  {\n    double result = getTotalOutstanding();\n    sendBill();\n    return result;\n}\n```\n\nThis way, you have separated your concerns and made the code more readable. The `getTotalOutstanding` method is a query that retrieves the total outstanding amount, while the `sendBill` method is a modifier that sends a bill.\n",

Or are you asking about naming conventions or something else entirely? \n\nIf you're asking about splitting the variable, then there isn't really any concept of \"splitting\" in programming as such. You can create a new variable that holds the result of an expression if you want to use it later. For example:\n\n```java\nint temp = 2 * (height + width);\nSystem.out.println(temp); // prints 2*(height+width)\ntemp = height * width;\nSystem.out.println(temp); // prints height*width\n```\n\nIf you're asking about naming conventions, then there are some good ones to follow:\n\n1. Variable names should be descriptive and not too long.\n2. They can contain letters, numbers, the dollar sign `$`, or underscore `_` but they cannot start with a number.\n3. Java is case sensitive so `temp` and `Temp` would be two different variables.\n4. Reserved words in Java (like `int`, `class`, etc.) should not be used as variable names.\n5. Variable names follow camelCase convention i.e., the first letter of each subsequent word is capitalized. For example: `camelCaseVariableName`.\n\nIf you could provide more context or clarify your question, I would be able to give a more accurate answer.\n",
