        "content": "Your method `getTotalOutstandingAndSendBill()` is already separated into a query (retrieving the total outstanding amount) and a modifier (sending a bill). The separation of responsibilities in object-oriented programming is good practice. \n\nHowever, if you want to separate them further into two different methods, one for retrieving the data (query), and another for sending the bill (modifier), here's how you can do it:\n\n```java\npublic double getTotalOutstanding() {\n    double result = 0;\n    for(Invoice each : customer.getInvoices()) {\n        result += each.getAmount();\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n\npublic void sendBill() {\n    // Code to send bill goes here\n}\n```\n\nNow, you can call `sendBill()` method whenever you need to send a bill and get the total outstanding amount by calling `getTotalOutstanding()`. This way, your code is more readable and maintainable. \n\nPlease note that in Java, methods should be named according to their functionality, not according to how they are used (like \"rapist\"). So you might want to rename the method names based on what they do.\n",

The first part (productName–productId) is split by \"-\" and the second part (quantity) is parsed as an integer. Then we use the productId from the second part of orderData[0] to get the price from `priceList` map, and calculate the total orderPrice by multiplying quantity with productPrice.\n",
