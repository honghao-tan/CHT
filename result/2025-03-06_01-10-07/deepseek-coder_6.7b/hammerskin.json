        "content": "In order to replace the \"type\" parameter in your `createEmployee` method with a subclass of `Employee`, you would need to define these subclasses first. Let's say we have two types of employees - `Hammerskin` and `Regular`. Here is how you can do it:\n\n```java\npublic class Employee {\n    private String name;\n    \n    public Employee(String name) {\n        this.name = name;\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Hammerskin extends Employee {\n    public Hammerskin(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Regular extends Employee {\n    public Regular(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n}\n```\nThen, you can modify your `createEmployee` method to return an instance of the appropriate subclass:\n\n```java\npublic Employee createEmployee(String name, String type)  {\n    if (type.equals(\"hammerskin\")) {\n        return new Hammerskin(name);\n    } else {\n        return new Regular(name);\n    }\n}\n```\nThis way, you can easily add more types of employees by creating additional subclasses without changing the `createEmployee` method. For example, if you want to add a \"vip\" type:\n\n```java\npublic class VIP extends Employee {\n    public VIP(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n}\n```\nAnd then in your `createEmployee` method:\n\n```java\nif (type.equals(\"vip\")) {\n    return new VIP(name);\n}\n```\n",
