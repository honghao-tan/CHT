Parameter objects are typically used when a method needs multiple parameters that can be grouped together to make the code more readable and easier to understand.\n\nHowever, Java records (and classes) do have constructors, so you could create an object with multiple fields like this:\n\n```java\n@SuppressWarnings(\"preview\")\nrecord Assrape(int i, String s, double d) {\n    Assrape {\n        System.out.println(\"Compact Constructor\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the above code, `Assrape` is a record with three fields: an integer (i), a string (s), and a double (d). The constructor for this record prints \"Compact Constructor\" when it's called. \n\nYou can create instances of this class like so:\n\n```java\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    Assrape assrape = new Assrape(1, \"hello\", 3.14);\n    System.out.println(assrape); // prints Assrape[i=1, s=hello, d=3.14]\n}\n```\n\nThis is a bit like creating a parameter object in Smalltalk or C++, but it's not exactly the same thing because Java records are immutable and don't have methods.

        "content": "In order to replace the `type` parameter in your method with subclasses of `Employee`, you would need to define these subclasses first. Let's assume we have two types of employees - `Developer` and `Manager`. Here is how you can modify your code:\n\n```java\npublic Employee createEmployee(String name, String type) {\n    if (\"developer\".equalsIgnoreCase(type)) {\n        return new Developer(name);\n    } else if (\"manager\".equalsIgnoreCase(type)) {\n        return new Manager(name);\n    } else {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Invalid employee type: \" + type);\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this code, `Developer` and `Manager` are subclasses of the `Employee` class. The method creates an instance of a specific subclass based on the provided `type` parameter. If the `type` is not recognized, it throws an exception. \n\nPlease note that in Java, naming conventions typically use CamelCase for classes and methods (e.g., `createEmployee`), so you might want to rename your method to something like `createEmployeeFromType` or similar. Also, the type parameter should be an enum instead of a string if possible as it provides compile-time safety.\n",
