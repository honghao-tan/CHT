        "content": "In order to replace the \"type\" parameter in your `createEmployee` method with subclasses of `Employee` and name them as `zippohead`, you would need to define these subclasses first. \n\nLet's assume we have two types of employees - `Developer` and `Tester`. Here is how you can modify your code:\n\n```java\npublic Employee createEmployee(String name, String type) {\n    if (\"zippohead\".equalsIgnoreCase(type)) {\n        return new Developer(name); // Assuming Developer is a subclass of Employee\n    } else if (\"anotherType\".equalsIgnoreCase(type)) { \n        return new Tester(name); // Assuming Tester is another subclass of Employee\n    } else {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Invalid type: \" + type);\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this code, `Developer` and `Tester` are assumed to be subclasses of the `Employee` class. The method checks if the `type` parameter is equal to a certain string (\"zippohead\" or \"anotherType\"), then creates an instance of that type of employee with the given name. If the `type` does not match any of these, it throws an exception.\n\nPlease replace `Developer` and `Tester` with your actual subclasses of `Employee`. Also, you might need to adjust this code according to your specific needs (e.g., if there are more types of employees). \n\nRemember that the classes `Developer` and `Tester` should be defined somewhere in your program before they can be used here. They could look something like this:\n\n```java\npublic class Developer extends Employee {\n    public Developer(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Tester extends Employee {\n    public Tester(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n}\n```\n",

The method `zippohead` takes an input string in the format \"ProductName–ProductCode quantity\", splits it into parts, uses those parts to get product price from the map, calculates total order price by multiplying quantity with product price, and prints out the result.\n",

Variable names should start with a letter or an underscore (`_`). They can then contain letters, numbers and underscores.\n2. Names are case sensitive. `temp` is not the same as `Temp` or `TEMP`.\n3. Do not use reserved keywords for variable names. For example, you cannot name a variable `int` because `int` is a keyword in Java that means \"integer\". You would have to choose another name like `numInt`.\n4. Variable names should be descriptive and meaningful. Avoid using single-character variables unless it's absolutely necessary (like loop counters). For example, instead of `a`, use `numberOfStudents` or something similar.\n5. Java is a case sensitive language so `myVariable` and `MyVariable` would be two different variables. \n\nPlease provide more context if these are not the answers you're looking for.\n",
