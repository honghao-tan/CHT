If such a name is provided, an `IllegalArgumentException` will be thrown. \n- The getter method `getName()` now returns \"occupant\" if the customer's name is \"unknown\", and otherwise it returns the actual name of the customer.

The `sendBill()` method can be called separately to send a bill if needed. This way you separate the concerns clearly and adheres to good object-oriented design principles.\n",
