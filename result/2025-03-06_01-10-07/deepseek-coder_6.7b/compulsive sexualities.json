        "content": "Your question seems to be related to object-oriented programming in Java. However, it's not clear what the `type` parameter represents and how you want to use it. Assuming that you have different types of employees (subclasses) each with their own unique properties or methods, here is a basic example:\n\n```java\npublic abstract class Employee {\n    private String name;\n\n    public Employee(String name) {\n        this.name = name;\n    }\n\n    // getter and setter for name\n}\n\npublic class CompulsiveSexualities extends Employee {\n    // Additional properties or methods specific to compulsive sexual activities go here\n\n    public CompulsiveSexualities(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n}\n\n// Other subclasses for other types of employees can be created in a similar way.\n\npublic class EmployeeFactory {\n    public static Employee createEmployee(String name, String type) {\n        if (\"compulsiveSexualities\".equalsIgnoreCase(type)) {\n            return new CompulsiveSexualities(name);\n        } \n        // Add more else-if statements for other types of employees.\n        \n        // If no match is found, you might want to throw an exception or handle it in some way.\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this example, `EmployeeFactory` creates instances of different subclasses based on the provided type string. The `createEmployee` method can be used like so:\n\n```java\nEmployee emp = EmployeeFactory.createEmployee(\"John Doe\", \"compulsiveSexualities\");\n```\nThis will create a new instance of `CompulsiveSexualities` with the name \"John Doe\". You would need to add more else-if statements for other types of employees, and handle cases where no match is found.\n",

It's not clear what you mean by \"modifier\" in your question, but assuming that it refers to something like changing the state of an object or returning a value without side effects, here is how I would separate these into two different methods:\n\n```java\npublic double getTotalOutstanding() {\n    double result = 0;\n    for (Invoice each : customer.getInvoices()) {\n        result += each.getAmount();\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n\npublic void sendBill() {\n    // Implementation of sending bill goes here\n}\n```\n\nThen you can call these methods as needed:\n\n```java\ndouble totalOutstanding = getTotalOutstanding();\nsendBill();  // This method does not return a value, so it's called with no arguments.\n```\n\nIf you want to combine the two into one method that returns both values, you could do something like this:\n\n```java\npublic TotalAndSendResult getTotalOutstandingAndSendBill() {\n    double total = getTotalOutstanding();\n    sendBill();  // This method does not return a value, so it's called with no arguments.\n    \n    return new TotalAndSendResult(total, /* bill sent status */);\n}\n```\n\nWhere `TotalAndSendResult` is a simple class that holds the total and the send status:\n\n```java\npublic class TotalAndSendResult {\n    private double total;\n    private boolean billSent;\n    \n    public TotalAndSendResult(double total, boolean billSent) {\n        this.total = total;\n        this.billSent = billSent;\n    }\n    \n    // Getters for total and billSent go here...\n}\n```\n",
