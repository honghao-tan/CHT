Here is how you can modify your code:\n\n```java\npublic Employee createEmployee(String name, String type) {\n    if (type.equals(\"prostitute\")) {\n        return new Prostitute(name);\n    } else {\n        return new RegularEmployee(name);\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this code, `Prostitute` and `RegularEmployee` are subclasses of the `Employee` class. The method now creates an instance of either a `Prostitute` or a `RegularEmployee` based on the value of the `type` parameter. \n\nPlease note that this is just one way to handle it, and you might have different ways depending on your specific requirements and design choices. For example, if there are many types of employees, you may want to use a factory pattern or similar design patterns instead of hardcoding the type in the method.\n",

        "content": "Your method `getTotalOutstandingAndSendBill` seems to be doing two things: calculating the total outstanding amount and sending a bill. It's not clear what \"prostitute\" means in this context, but assuming it refers to separation of concerns (i.e., separating querying from modifying), you could refactor your method like so:\n\n```java\npublic double getTotalOutstanding() {\n    double result = 0;\n    for(Invoice each : customer.getInvoices()) {\n        result += each.getAmount();\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n\npublic void sendBill() {\n    // implementation of sending bill goes here\n}\n```\n\nNow, `getTotalOutstanding` is a query method that calculates the total outstanding amount and `sendBill` is a modifier method that sends a bill. This way, you separate the concerns of calculating and sending bills which makes your code more readable and maintainable. \n\nPlease note that in Java, methods should be named according to their functionality, not roles or responsibilities. So, it might make sense to rename `getTotalOutstanding` to something like `calculateTotalOutstandingAmount` for clarity. Similarly, you could name the `sendBill` method as `sendInvoice` or `emailInvoice` based on its functionality.\n",

Also, it assumes that all prices are stored as integers in priceList with keys being product IDs.\n",
