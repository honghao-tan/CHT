        "content": "In order to replace the \"type\" parameter in your `createEmployee` method with subclasses of an abstract `Employee` class, you would need to define these subclasses first. Let's assume we have two types of employees - `BeanerBaby` and `RegularEmployee`:\n\n```java\npublic abstract class Employee {\n    private String name;\n    \n    public Employee(String name) {\n        this.name = name;\n    }\n    \n    // getters and setters for the 'name' field...\n}\n\npublic class BeanerBaby extends Employee {\n    public BeanerBaby(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n    \n    // Additional methods or properties specific to BeanerBabies go here...\n}\n\npublic class RegularEmployee extends Employee {\n    public RegularEmployee(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n    \n    // Additional methods or properties specific to regular employees go here...\n}\n```\nThen, you can modify your `createEmployee` method like this:\n\n```java\npublic Employee createEmployee(String name, String type) {\n    if (\"BeanerBaby\".equalsIgnoreCase(type)) {\n        return new BeanerBaby(name);\n    } else {\n        return new RegularEmployee(name);\n    }\n}\n```\nThis way, you can create different types of employees by passing the type as a string to your `createEmployee` method. If \"BeanerBaby\" is passed, it will return an instance of `BeanerBaby`; otherwise, it will return an instance of `RegularEmployee`.\n",

The `getTotalOutstanding` method retrieves invoices from the customer and sums their amounts. The `sendBill` method is private because it's not intended to be used outside of this class. If you need to send a bill, you can call `beanerBabyInstance.sendBill()` but it won't return anything (void).\n",

The first part (after splitting by space) contains the details of the product and its quantity, which are further split by \"-\". The second part of the productDetails array gives you the key for getting the price from the map.
