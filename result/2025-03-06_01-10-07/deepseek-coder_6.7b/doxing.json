They come with several features like automatic generation of methods (toString(), equals() etc.), immutability, and hashcode.\n\nHowever, the `record` keyword does not support parameters in its definition as you have mentioned in your question. If you want to introduce a new parameter object, you can define it separately from the record class:\n\n```java\npublic class Doxing {\n    private int i;\n    \n    public Doxing(int i) {\n        this.i = i;\n    }\n    \n    // getters and setters for i\n}\n\n@SuppressWarnings(\"preview\")\nrecord R(int i)  {\n\tR {\n\t\tSystem.out.println(\"Compact Constructor\");\n\t}\n}\n```\nIn this example, `Doxing` is a separate class that represents an object with one field (i). You can then use it in your code like any other object:\n\n```java\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    Doxing doxing = new Doxing(10);\n    System.out.println(doxing.getI()); // prints 10\n}\n```\nThis way, you can introduce a new parameter object without using the `record` keyword.
