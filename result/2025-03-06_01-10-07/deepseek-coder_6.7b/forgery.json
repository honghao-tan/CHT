        "content": "In order to replace the \"type\" parameter in your `createEmployee` method with subclasses of the `Employee` class and name them as \"forgery\", you would need to define these subclasses first. Let's assume we have two subclasses, `Forger` and `Copywriter`, which inherit from the `Employee` superclass:\n\n```java\npublic abstract class Employee {\n    private String name;\n    \n    public Employee(String name) {\n        this.name = name;\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Forger extends Employee {\n    public Forger(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Copywriter extends Employee {\n    public Copywriter(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n}\n```\nThen, you can modify your `createEmployee` method to create instances of these subclasses based on the \"type\" parameter:\n\n```java\npublic Employee createEmployee(String name, String type)  {\n    if (\"forgery\".equalsIgnoreCase(type)) {\n        return new Forger(name);\n    } else if (\"copywriting\".equalsIgnoreCase(type)) {\n        return new Copywriter(name);\n    } else {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Invalid type: \" + type);\n    }\n}\n```\nThis way, when you call `createEmployee` with a \"forgery\" type, it will create an instance of the `Forger` subclass. If you pass in \"copywriting\", it will create an instance of the `Copywriter` subclass. For any other value, it throws an exception.\n",

The `sendBill` method can be used to send a bill (or whatever you need it for). This adheres to the principle of separation of concerns in software development.\n",
