        "content": "Your method `getTotalOutstandingAndSendBill()` seems to be doing two things - calculating the total outstanding amount and sending a bill. It's not clear what \"sendBill()\" does, but assuming it sends an email or some other form of notification, you might want to separate that out into its own method as well.\n\nHere is how you could refactor your code:\n\n```java\npublic double getTotalOutstanding() {\n    double result = 0;\n    for (Invoice each : customer.getInvoices()) {\n        result += each.getAmount();\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n\npublic void sendBill() {\n    // Implementation of sending bill goes here\n}\n```\n\nNow, `getTotalOutstanding()` is a query method that returns the total outstanding amount without sending a bill. The `sendBill()` method can be called separately to send a bill if needed. \n\nPlease replace the comment \"// Implementation of sending bill goes here\" with your actual implementation for sending bills.\n",

For example, priceList.put(\"Faggy\", 10);\n\nString[] orderData = orderString.split(\"\\\\s+\"); // Split the string into parts by whitespace\nString[] productDetails = orderData[0].split(\"–\"); // Split the first part of the string further to get product name and quantity\nint quantity = Integer.parseInt(orderData[1]);  // Get the quantity from the second part of the string\n\n// Assuming that you have a method `getProductPrice` which takes product name as argument and returns its price\nint productPrice = getProductPrice(productDetails[0]);  \n\nint orderPrice = quantity * productPrice; // Calculate total cost\n```\n\nPlease replace `\"Faggy\"`, `2`, and the `priceList` with your actual data. The method `getProductPrice` is not provided in this code snippet but you should have a way to get the price of a product from your database or other source. \n\nThis code assumes that the order string has two parts separated by one or more spaces, and each part can be further split into product name and quantity using `–` as separator. The total cost is calculated by multiplying the quantity with the price of the product.\n",

The first operation multiplies the sum of `height` and `width` by 2, while the second operation multiplies `height` and `width` directly. Both results are printed to the console.\n",
