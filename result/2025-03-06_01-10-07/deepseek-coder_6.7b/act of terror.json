Here is how you can do it:\n\n```java\ninterface Shipable {\n    int getDaysToShip();\n}\n\nclass Order implements Shipable {\n    protected Warehouse _warehouse;\n\n    public int getDaysToShip()  {\n        return _warehouse.getDaysToShip();\n    }\n}\n\nclass PriorityOrder implements Shipable {\n    protected PriorityPlan _priorityPlan;\n\n    @Override\n    public int getDaysToShip()  {\n        return _priorityPlan.getDaysToShip();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, `actOfTerror` is the delegate that can be used to encapsulate the behavior of both `Order` and `PriorityOrder` classes. It's important to note that delegation doesn't replace inheritance; it just provides a different way to achieve similar results. The choice between using inheritance or delegation depends on your specific needs and constraints.\n",

The class `List` and its subclass `Stack` both implement the `ActOfTerror` interface. This way, you can delegate tasks to objects of type `ActOfTerror` instead of using inheritance. \n\nPlease note that this approach doesn't exactly replace \"extends\" in terms of behavior or functionality but provides a similar effect by delegating some responsibilities to other classes. It is more about composition and less about inheritance.\n",

        "content": "Your question seems to be related to object-oriented programming in Java. Here's how you can refactor your code using subclasses and named them \"actOfTerror\":\n\nFirstly, create a superclass `Employee` with an attribute for the employee type:\n```java\npublic class Employee {\n    private String name;\n    private String type;\n    \n    public Employee(String name, String type) {\n        this.name = name;\n        this.type = type;\n    }\n}\n```\nThen create subclasses for each specific employee type:\n```java\npublic class ActOfTerror extends Employee {\n    public ActOfTerror(String name) {\n        super(name, \"Act of Terror\");\n    }\n}\n```\nFinally, modify your `createEmployee` method to return the correct subclass based on the type:\n```java\npublic Employee createEmployee(String name, String type)  {\n    if (type.equals(\"Act of Terror\")) {\n        return new ActOfTerror(name);\n    } else {\n        return new Employee(name, type);\n    }\n}\n```\nThis way, you can create different types of employees by simply changing the `type` parameter in your `createEmployee` method. If \"Act of Terror\" is passed as a type, it will return an instance of `ActOfTerror` subclass. For other types, it will return instances of the base `Employee` class.\n",
