        "content": "In order to replace the \"type\" parameter in your `createEmployee` method with subclasses of `Employee` and name them as \"whoremongers\", you would need to define these subclasses first. Here's an example assuming that there are two types of employees, one named \"Whoremonger1\" and the other named \"Whoremonger2\".\n\n```java\npublic class Employee {\n    private String name;\n    \n    public Employee(String name) {\n        this.name = name;\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Whoremonger1 extends Employee {\n    // Additional properties or methods for Whoremonger1 go here\n\n    public Whoremonger1(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Whoremonger2 extends Employee {\n    // Additional properties or methods for Whoremonger2 go here\n\n    public Whoremonger2(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n}\n```\nThen you can modify your `createEmployee` method to return instances of these subclasses:\n\n```java\npublic Employee createEmployee(String name, String type)  {\n    if (type.equals(\"Whoremonger1\")) {\n        return new Whoremonger1(name);\n    } else if (type.equals(\"Whoremonger2\")) {\n        return new Whoremonger2(name);\n    } else {\n        // Handle other types of employees here or throw an exception\n        return new Employee(name);  // Default to regular employee\n    }\n}\n```\nThis way, you can create instances of different types of `Employee` subclasses based on the \"type\" parameter. Please adjust this code according to your actual class structure and requirements.\n",

        "content": "Your method `getTotalOutstandingAndSendBill` seems to be doing two things - calculating the total outstanding amount and sending a bill. It's not clear what \"whoremongers\" is in your context, but assuming it refers to something related to invoices or customers, here are two separate methods:\n\n1. Query method `getTotalOutstanding` that calculates the total outstanding amount:\n```java\npublic double getTotalOutstanding() {\n    double result = 0;\n    for(Invoice each : customer.getInvoices()) {\n        result += each.getAmount();\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n```\n2. Modifier method `sendBill` that sends a bill:\n```java\npublic void sendBill() {\n    // Implementation of sending the bill goes here\n}\n```\nYou can call these methods separately as per your requirement. If you want to calculate total outstanding and also send a bill, you can do so in one method like this:\n```java\npublic double getTotalOutstandingAndSendBill() {\n    double result = getTotalOutstanding();\n    sendBill();\n    return result;\n}\n```\nThis way, the `getTotalOutstanding` and `sendBill` methods are separated from each other and can be reused in different parts of your program. The method `getTotalOutstandingAndSendBill` now calculates total outstanding amount and sends a bill at once.\n",
