Here is how you can modify your code:\n\n```java\npublic Employee createEmployee(String name, String type) {\n    if (\"developer\".equalsIgnoreCase(type)) {\n        return new Developer(name);\n    } else if (\"manager\".equalsIgnoreCase(type)) {\n        return new Manager(name);\n    } else {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Invalid employee type: \" + type);\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this code, `Developer` and `Manager` are subclasses of the `Employee` class. The method creates an instance of a specific subclass based on the provided `type` parameter. If the `type` is not recognized, it throws an `IllegalArgumentException`. \n\nPlease note that this code assumes you have defined classes named `Developer` and `Manager` in your project. You would need to define these classes according to your specific requirements.\n",

        "content": "Your method `getTotalOutstandingAndSendBill` seems to be doing two things: calculating the total outstanding amount and sending a bill. It's good practice to separate these into different methods for better code organization and readability. Here is how you can do it:\n\n```java\npublic double getTotalOutstanding() {\n    double result = 0;\n    for (Invoice each : customer.getInvoices()) {\n        result += each.getAmount();\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n\npublic void sendBill() {\n    // Implementation of sending bill goes here\n}\n```\n\nNow, you can call `sendBill` method in your `getTotalOutstandingAndSendBill` like this:\n\n```java\npublic double getTotalOutstandingAndSendBill()  {\n    double result = getTotalOutstanding();\n    sendBill();\n    return result;\n}\n```\n\nThis way, you have separated the query (getting total outstanding) from the modifier (sending bill), and each does one thing. This makes your code easier to understand and maintain.\n",

The method `get()` of the Map interface is used to get the price for a given productId.\n\nPlease replace \"productName\", \"productId\", \"quantity\" with your actual data in the orderString variable. Also, make sure that the productId exists in the priceList map before trying to access it. If not, you might want to handle this case as well.\n",
