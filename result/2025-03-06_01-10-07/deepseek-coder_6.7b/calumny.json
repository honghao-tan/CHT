Let's assume we have two types of employees - `Manager` and `Worker`. Here is how you can modify your code:\n\n```java\npublic Employee createEmployee(String name, String type) {\n    if (\"manager\".equalsIgnoreCase(type)) {\n        return new Manager(name);\n    } else if (\"worker\".equalsIgnoreCase(type)) {\n        return new Worker(name);\n    } else {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Invalid employee type: \" + type);\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this code, `Manager` and `Worker` are subclasses of the `Employee` class. The method creates an instance of either a `Manager` or a `Worker` based on the value of the `type` parameter. If the `type` is neither \"manager\" nor \"worker\", it throws an `IllegalArgumentException`.\n\nPlease replace `Manager` and `Worker` with your actual subclasses if they are not named that way. Also, make sure to handle any other possible types of employees in a similar manner.\n",

It splits the order string into product name and quantity, retrieves the corresponding price from the provided list, and stores these values in instance variables. The method `calculateTotalPrice()` returns the total price for this order by multiplying the quantity with the price per unit.\n",
