Here's an example:\n\n```java\npublic class Dummy { // renamed\n    void test1() {\n        class InnerClass {}; \n        InnerClass d = new InnerClass();\n    }\n    \n    void test2() {\n        class InnerClass {}; \n        InnerClass d = new InnerClass();\n    }\n}\n```\nPlease note that in Java, inner classes are not tied to the outer class and can be used independently of it. If you want your \"Dummy\" class to behave like a Test class (which is not recommended), you would need to move all methods into Dummy or create static nested classes if they should have access to other non-static members of the enclosing class.\n",

        "content": "Your method `getTotalOutstandingAndSendBill()` seems to be doing two things - calculating the total outstanding amount and sending a bill. It's good practice to separate these into different methods for better code organization and readability. Here is how you can do it:\n\n```java\npublic double getTotalOutstanding() {\n    double result = 0;\n    for(Invoice each : customer.getInvoices()) {\n        result += each.getAmount();\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n\npublic void sendBill() {\n    // Implementation of sending bill goes here\n}\n```\n\nNow, you can call `getTotalOutstanding()` to get the total outstanding amount and `sendBill()` to send a bill. This way, your code is more modular and easier to understand. \n\nPlease replace the comment with actual implementation of sending a bill as per your requirement.\n",

        "content": "The code you provided is a Java snippet that splits an order string into its components and calculates the total price of an item based on its quantity and corresponding price in a list. Here's how it works:\n\n```java\nString[] orderData = orderString.split(\"\\\\s+\"); // Split the order string by one or more whitespace characters\nString[] productDetails = orderData[0].split(\"–\"); // Split the first part of the order data (product details) by \"–\"\nint productPrice = priceList.get(productDetails[1]); // Get the price of the product from the price list using its name\nint orderPrice = Integer.parseInt(orderData[1]) * productPrice; // Calculate the total price of the ordered quantity of the product\n```\n\nThis code assumes that `orderString` is a string in the format \"productName–productCode quantity\", where \"productName\" and \"productCode\" are strings, and \"quantity\" is an integer. The prices for each product are stored in a map named `priceList` with product codes as keys and their corresponding prices as values.\n\nThe variable `orderPrice` will hold the total price of the ordered quantity of the product. If you want to get the name of the product, you can use `productDetails[0]`. \n\nPlease note that this code does not handle potential exceptions such as ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException if the order data or product details are not in the expected format, or NumberFormatException if the quantity cannot be parsed into an integer. You should add appropriate error handling to your code for production use.\n",
