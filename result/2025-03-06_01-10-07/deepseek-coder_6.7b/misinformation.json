The `valueOf` method you mentioned is not valid for an enum type, it should be used with class instances.\n\nThe switch statement on the other hand, works with expressions of certain types (like integers and enums) to execute different pieces of code based on the value of the expression. It doesn't create a new variable like in some languages. \n\nIf you want to assign an enum value to a temporary variable, you can do it directly:\n\n```csharp\nenum Bug { X }\n\nBug myEnum = Bug.X; // This will create a temporary variable 'myEnum' and assign the value of 'X' to it.\n```\n\nIf you want to use switch with enum, here is an example:\n\n```csharp\nenum Bug { X, Y }\nBug myBug = Bug.X; // Assuming we have a variable 'myBug' of type Bug and its value is 'X'.\n\nswitch(myBug) \n{\n    case Bug.X:\n        Console.WriteLine(\"This is X\");\n        break;\n    case Bug.Y:\n        Console.WriteLine(\"This is Y\");\n        break;\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, the switch statement checks the value of `myBug` and executes different pieces of code based on its value. If `myBug` has a value of 'X', it will print \"This is X\". If it's 'Y', it will print \"This is Y\".\n",

        "content": "In order to replace the \"type\" parameter in your `createEmployee` method with subclasses of `Employee` and name them as `Misinformation`, you would need to define these subclasses first. Here's an example assuming that there are two types of employees - `RegularEmployee` and `MisinformationEmployee`:\n\n```java\npublic class Employee {\n    private String name;\n    \n    public Employee(String name) {\n        this.name = name;\n    }\n}\n\npublic class RegularEmployee extends Employee {\n    public RegularEmployee(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n}\n\npublic class MisinformationEmployee extends Employee {\n    public MisinformationEmployee(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n}\n```\nThen you can modify your `createEmployee` method to create instances of these subclasses:\n\n```java\npublic Employee createEmployee(String name, String type)  {\n    if (type.equals(\"Regular\")) {\n        return new RegularEmployee(name);\n    } else if (type.equals(\"Misinformation\")) {\n        return new MisinformationEmployee(name);\n    } else {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Invalid type: \" + type);\n    }\n}\n```\nThis way, you can create instances of `RegularEmployee` or `MisinformationEmployee` based on the provided type. If an invalid type is passed, it throws an exception. \n\nPlease note that this code assumes that there are two types of employees - \"Regular\" and \"Misinformation\".

It splits the order data into parts, checks if the product exists in the price list, calculates the total order price, and prints it out. If there are any issues with the input string or missing product details, an error message is printed to `System.err`.\n",
