But remember, Java is a case-sensitive language and `Lynch` and `lynch` are not the same. \n\nIf you want to dynamically change the name of your classes during runtime in Java, it's not possible because class names are resolved at compile time by the JVM or ClassLoader. You can only use reflection to manipulate a class after it has been loaded into memory. But this is generally considered bad practice and should be avoided if possible.\n",

        "content": "Your method `getTotalOutstandingAndSendBill()` is already separated into a query (retrieving the total outstanding amount) and a modifier (sending a bill). The separation of concerns in object-oriented programming allows for better code organization, readability, and maintainability. \n\nHowever, if you want to separate them further into two different methods, one for querying (getting the total outstanding amount) and another for sending a bill, here's how you can do it:\n\n```java\npublic double getTotalOutstanding() {\n    double result = 0;\n    for(Invoice each : customer.getInvoices()) {\n        result += each.getAmount();\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n\npublic void sendBill() {\n    // Code to send bill goes here\n}\n```\n\nNow, you can call `sendBill()` method whenever you need to send a bill and get the total outstanding amount by calling `getTotalOutstanding()`. This way, your code is more modular and easier to understand. \n\nPlease note that in Java, methods should be named according to their functionality, not according to how they are used (like \"lynch\"). So you might want to rename the method names for better readability.\n",
