This way, you can handle special cases like this in your program. \n\nPlease note that I used `equalsIgnoreCase()` for comparing strings as it ignores case sensitivity. If you want to keep the original value of unknown customer's name then remove if-else block from constructor and change getName method accordingly:\n\n```java\npublic String getName() {\n    return \"unknown\".equals(name) ? \"occupant\" : name;\n}\n```\n",

Here is how you can modify your code:\n\n```java\npublic Employee createEmployee(String name, String type) {\n    if (type.equals(\"deception\")) {\n        return new Deception(name);\n    } else {\n        return new RegularEmployee(name);\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this code, `Deception` and `RegularEmployee` are subclasses of the `Employee` class. The `createEmployee` method now creates instances of these classes based on the provided type parameter. \n\nPlease note that you need to define `Deception` and `RegularEmployee` classes in your code before using them here. Here is a simple example:\n\n```java\npublic class Employee {\n    private String name;\n    \n    public Employee(String name) {\n        this.name = name;\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Deception extends Employee {\n    public Deception(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n}\n\npublic class RegularEmployee extends Employee {\n    public RegularEmployee(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code defines two subclasses of `Employee`, `Deception` and `RegularEmployee`. The `createEmployee` method can now create instances of these classes based on the provided type parameter. \n\nPlease replace `\"deception\"` with your actual types if they are different. Also, make sure to handle any other possible cases in your real code. This example assumes that \"deception\" is a special case and creates an instance of `Deception` class. If you have more employee types, you would need to add additional conditions to the method.\n",

        "content": "Your method `getTotalOutstandingAndSendBill()` is a bit confusing as it both queries (gets the total outstanding amount) and modifies (sends a bill). It's better to separate these two operations. Here's how you can do this in Java:\n\n```java\npublic double getTotalOutstanding() {\n    double result = 0;\n    for(Invoice each : customer.getInvoices()) {\n        result += each.getAmount();\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n\npublic void sendBill() {\n    // Implementation of sending bill goes here\n}\n```\n\nNow, `getTotalOutstanding()` is a query method that returns the total outstanding amount without modifying anything. The `sendBill()` method can be used as a modifier to actually send the bill (without returning any value). \n\nPlease replace the comment with your actual implementation of sending a bill.\n",

        "content": "The code you provided is a Java snippet that splits an order string into its components and calculates the total cost of the ordered item based on the price list.

The result is stored in `orderData`.\n\n2. `String[] productDetails = orderData[0].split(\"–\");` - This line splits the first element of `orderData` (which should be the product details) by \"–\", resulting in an array of strings where each element represents a part of the original string. The result is stored in `productDetails`.\n\n3. `int productPrice = priceList.get(productDetails[1]);` - This line retrieves the price for the product from the `priceList` map using the second element of `productDetails` as the key. It assumes that `priceList` is a Map<String, Integer> where each entry maps a product code to its corresponding price.\n\n4. `int orderPrice = Integer.parseInt(orderData[1]) * productPrice;` - This line calculates the total cost of the ordered item by multiplying the quantity (which is parsed from the second element of `orderData`) with the product's price. The result is stored in `orderPrice`.\n\nIn summary, this code deceptively splits an order string into its components and uses a method for querying price based on a provided list. It then calculates the total cost of the ordered item.\n",
