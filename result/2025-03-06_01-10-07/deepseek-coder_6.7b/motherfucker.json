It's good practice to separate these into different methods for better code organization and readability. Here is how you can do it:\n\n```java\npublic double getTotalOutstanding() {\n    double result = 0;\n    for (Invoice each : customer.getInvoices()) {\n        result += each.getAmount();\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n\npublic void sendBill() {\n    // Implementation of sending bill goes here\n}\n```\n\nNow, you can call `sendBill()` method inside the `getTotalOutstandingAndSendBill()`:\n\n```java\npublic double getTotalOutstandingAndSendBill()  {\n    double result = getTotalOutstanding();\n    sendBill();\n    return result;\n}\n```\n\nThis way, you have separated your concerns and made the code more readable. The `getTotalOutstanding` method is only responsible for calculating the total outstanding amount, while the `sendBill()` method handles sending a bill. This makes it easier to maintain and update each part of your program separately.\n",

The key to get the price for a specific product is the name of the product itself (which you can extract from `productDetails[1]`). \n\nPlease replace the placeholders with your actual data if they're different.
