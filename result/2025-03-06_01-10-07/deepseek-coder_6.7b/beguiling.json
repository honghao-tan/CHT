        "content": "The code you provided is a Java snippet that splits an order string into its components and calculates the total cost of the ordered item based on the price list. Here's how it works:\n\n1. `String[] orderData = orderString.split(\"\\\\s+\");` - This line splits the input string `orderString` by one or more whitespace characters into an array of strings, and stores them in `orderData`. The result is that `orderData[0]` contains the product details and `orderData[1]` contains the quantity ordered.\n\n2. `String[] productDetails = orderData[0].split(\"–\");` - This line splits the first element of `orderData` (which should contain the product code and name separated by \"–\") into an array of strings, with each string being a part of the original string split at the \"–\" character. The result is that `productDetails[0]` contains the product code and `productDetails[1]` contains the product name.\n\n3. `int productPrice = priceList.get(productDetails[1]);` - This line retrieves the price of the ordered item from the `priceList` map using the product name (which is stored in `productDetails[1]`). The result is that `productPrice` contains the price of the ordered item.\n\n4. `int orderPrice = Integer.parseInt(orderData[1]) * productPrice;` - This line calculates the total cost of the ordered items by multiplying the quantity ordered (which is stored in `orderData[1]`, parsed to an integer) with the price per item (stored in `productPrice`). The result is that `orderPrice` contains the total order price.\n\nIn summary, this code takes a string representing an order and calculates its total cost based on a provided list of prices for each product. It's designed to work with strings formatted as \"ProductCode–ProductName quantity\", where \"quantity\" is the number of items ordered. The `priceList` map should contain entries mapping product names (not codes) to their respective prices.\n",

Then we print out the value of `temp` which is `30`. After that, we use the original variables `height` and `width` to perform another operation (multiplication), and print out the result.\n",
