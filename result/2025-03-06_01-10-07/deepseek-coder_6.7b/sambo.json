        "content": "In order to replace the `type` parameter in your method with subclasses of `Employee`, you would need to define these subclasses first. Let's assume we have two types of employees - `Developer` and `Manager`. Here is how you can modify your code:\n\n```java\npublic Employee createEmployee(String name, String type) {\n    if (\"developer\".equalsIgnoreCase(type)) {\n        return new Developer(name);\n    } else if (\"manager\".equalsIgnoreCase(type)) {\n        return new Manager(name);\n    } else {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Invalid employee type: \" + type);\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this code, `Developer` and `Manager` are subclasses of the `Employee` class. The method creates an instance of a specific subclass based on the provided `type` parameter. If the `type` is not recognized, it throws an exception. \n\nPlease note that in Java, naming conventions typically use CamelCase for classes (i.e., `Developer` and `Manager`), so you might want to consider renaming these subclasses accordingly. Also, this code assumes that the `Employee` class has a constructor that takes a name as an argument. If it doesn't, you would need to add one.\n",

        "content": "Your method `getTotalOutstandingAndSendBill()` is already separated into a query (retrieving the total outstanding amount) and a modifier (sending a bill). The separation of concerns in object-oriented programming allows for better code organization, readability, and maintainability. \n\nHowever, if you want to separate the query from the modifier, you can create two different methods: one for getting the total outstanding amount and another for sending a bill. Here's how you could do it:\n\n```java\npublic double getTotalOutstanding() {\n    double result = 0;\n    for (Invoice each : customer.getInvoices()) {\n        result += each.getAmount();\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n\npublic void sendBill() {\n    // Code to send bill goes here\n}\n```\n\nThen, you can call `sendBill()` in the method where it's needed:\n\n```java\npublic double getTotalOutstandingAndSendBill() {\n    double total = getTotalOutstanding();\n    sendBill(); // Calling the modifier (sending a bill)\n    return total;\n}\n```\n\nThis way, you have separated your concerns and made your code more modular. The `getTotalOutstanding` method is only responsible for calculating the outstanding amount, while the `sendBill` method is solely responsible for sending a bill. This makes it easier to maintain and understand your code.\n",
