The `equalsIgnoreCase` method is used so that the comparison is case-insensitive. \n\nPlease note that this solution assumes you want to replace the entire string, not just part of it.

Here is how you can modify your code:\n\n```java\npublic Employee createEmployee(String name, String type) {\n    switch (type) {\n        case \"developer\":\n            return new Developer(name);\n        case \"manager\":\n            return new Manager(name);\n        case \"tester\":\n            return new Tester(name);\n        default:\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Invalid employee type\");\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this code, `Developer`, `Manager` and `Tester` are subclasses of the `Employee` class. The switch statement checks the value of `type` and returns a new instance of the appropriate subclass. If `type` does not match any of the cases, it throws an exception.\n",

        "content": "Your method `getTotalOutstandingAndSendBill()` is a bit confusing as it combines two different tasks - calculating the total outstanding amount and sending a bill. It's better to separate these into two distinct methods for clarity and maintainability. \n\nHere's how you can do this in Java:\n\n```java\npublic double getTotalOutstanding() {\n    double result = 0;\n    for (Invoice each : customer.getInvoices()) {\n        result += each.getAmount();\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n\npublic void sendBill() {\n    // Implementation of sending bill goes here\n}\n```\n\nNow, you can call `getTotalOutstanding()` to get the total outstanding amount and `sendBill()` to send a bill. This way, your code is more readable and maintainable. \n\nIf you want to calculate the total outstanding amount and also send a bill in one method, you could do something like this:\n\n```java\npublic double getTotalOutstandingAndSendBill() {\n    double result = getTotalOutstanding();\n    sendBill();\n    return result;\n}\n```\n\nThis way, `getTotalOutstandingAndSendBill()` does both tasks in one method. However, this is not recommended as it violates the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) of object-oriented programming and makes your code harder to maintain. It's better to keep methods small and single-responsible.\n",

Please replace these with your actual variables. \n\nAlso note that this code does not handle any potential exceptions (like ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException if the split arrays don't have enough elements).
