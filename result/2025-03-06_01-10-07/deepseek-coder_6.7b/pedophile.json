However, your code snippet is not clear enough for me to provide a more specific answer. \n\nHere are some general tips:\n1. Ensure `orderString` follows the format \"name–price quantity\" and that it's correctly split by spaces (\"\\\\s+\").\n2. Make sure `productDetails[1]` corresponds to an existing key in your `priceList` HashMap (or similar data structure).\n3. Be careful with integer parsing, ensure you handle any potential NumberFormatException.\n4. If the price of a product is not found in the list, it will throw a NullPointerException or ClassCastException. Make sure to check if the key exists before trying to access its value.\n5. The variable name `pedophile` doesn't make much sense as a method name. It would be better to choose a more descriptive and meaningful name for your method. \n\nIf you provide more context or clarify what exactly you want to achieve, I can give a more precise answer.\n",
