They don't have a name because they aren't declared with their own class statement. If you want to give them a name for clarity or organization purposes, you could declare them inside methods like so:\n\n```java\npublic class Bong {  \n    void test1() {  \n        class DummyClass {}  // Named the inner class as DummyClass\n        DummyClass d = new DummyClass();\n    }\n    \n    void test2() {\n        class AnotherDummyClass {}  // Named the inner class as AnotherDummyClass\n        AnotherDummyClass d = new AnotherDummyClass();\n    }\n}\n```\n",
