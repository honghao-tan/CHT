        "content": "In order to replace the \"type\" parameter in your `createEmployee` method with subclasses of `Employee` and name them as \"noose\", you would need to create a hierarchy of classes that extend from `Employee`. \n\nHere's an example of how this could be done:\n\n```java\npublic abstract class Employee {\n    private String name;\n    \n    public Employee(String name) {\n        this.name = name;\n    }\n}\n\npublic class NooseEmployee extends Employee {\n    public NooseEmployee(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n}\n```\nThen you can modify your `createEmployee` method to return a subclass of `Employee` based on the type:\n\n```java\npublic Employee createEmployee(String name, String type)  {\n    if (\"noose\".equalsIgnoreCase(type)) {\n        return new NooseEmployee(name);\n    } else {\n        // handle other types of employees here...\n    }\n}\n```\nThis way, you can easily add more employee types by creating additional subclasses of `Employee`. \n\nPlease note that this is a simple example and might not cover all the edge cases or requirements for your specific use case.

The method `split(\"\\\\s+\")` splits the input string by one or more whitespace characters. The method `split(\"–\")` splits the first part of the order data (which should be in the format \"productName–productDetails\") by \"-\", and the integer at index 1 of `orderData` is assumed to be the quantity ordered.\n",
