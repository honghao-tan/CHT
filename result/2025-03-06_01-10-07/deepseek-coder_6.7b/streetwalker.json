The Streetwalker class might have additional attributes or methods that are specific to streetwalkers. Here's an example of how you could implement this:\n\n```java\npublic class Customer {\n    private String name;\n\n    public Customer(String name)  {\n        if (\"unknown\".equals(name)) {\n            this.name = \"occupant\";\n        } else {\n            this.name = name;\n        }\n    }\n\n    public String getName()  {\n        return name;\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Streetwalker extends Customer {\n    private int stepsTaken; // additional attribute specific to streetwalkers\n\n    public Streetwalker(String name, int steps) {\n        super(name);\n        this.stepsTaken = steps;\n    }\n\n    public void walk() {\n        stepsTaken++; \n    }\n\n    public int getStepsTaken() {\n        return stepsTaken;\n    }\n}\n```\nIn the above code, `Streetwalker` is a subclass of `Customer`. It has an additional attribute `stepsTaken` and a method `walk()` to increment this value each time it's called. The constructor for `Streetwalker` takes two parameters: the name and steps taken by the streetwalker, which are passed to the superclass (`Customer`) constructor using `super(name)`.\n",

We then add that amount to the current salary of the person. This way, you can use the same method for different percent raises by just passing in a new value each time.

It might be more appropriate to use names that describe what the method does, like `calculateTotalOutstandingAmount` or `getCustomerDebt`.\n\nHere's how you can name it:\n\n```java\npublic double calculateTotalOutstandingAmount() {\n    double result = 0;\n    for (Invoice each : customer.getInvoices()) {\n        result += each.getAmount();\n    }\n    sendBill(); // assuming there's a method named `sendBill` in the same class\n    return result;\n}\n```\nThis way, you separate the query from the modifier and use a method for querying.
