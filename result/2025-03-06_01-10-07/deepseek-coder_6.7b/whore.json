        "content": "Your method `getTotalOutstandingAndSendBill()` is a bit confusing as it both queries (gets the total outstanding amount) and modifies (sends a bill). It's better to separate these two operations. Here's how you can do that:\n\n```java\npublic double getTotalOutstanding() {\n    double result = 0;\n    for(Invoice each : customer.getInvoices()) {\n        result += each.getAmount();\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n\npublic void sendBill() {\n    // Implementation of sending bill goes here\n}\n```\n\nNow, `getTotalOutstanding()` is a query method that returns the total outstanding amount without modifying anything. The `sendBill()` method can be used as a modifier to send a bill after calculating the total outstanding amount. \n\nPlease replace the comment with your actual implementation of sending a bill.\n",

The hyphen (`-`) is used to split the string into two parts: the name of the product and its corresponding index in the `priceList` map. \n\nPlease replace `<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>` with your variable that contains the price per unit.
