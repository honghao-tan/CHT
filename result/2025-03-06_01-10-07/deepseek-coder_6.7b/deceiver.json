The name of the file containing the code must match the name of the public class in that file. If you want to change the functionality of your program without changing its structure, you would have to create a new class with the desired name and copy over the existing methods and fields from the old class.\n",

If the `type` is not recognized, it throws an exception. \n\nPlease note that you need to define your `Developer`, `Tester` and `Deceiver` classes before using them in this method.
