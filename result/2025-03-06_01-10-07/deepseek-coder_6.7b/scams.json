If a known name is provided, that name will be used. The `equalsIgnoreCase` method ensures that the comparison of names is case-insensitive. \n\nYou can use this class in your main program like so:\n```java\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    Scams customer1 = new Scams(\"John\");\n    System.out.println(customer1.getName()); // prints \"John\"\n    \n    Scams customer2 = new Scams(\"unknown\");\n    System.out.println(customer2.getName()); // prints \"occupant\"\n}\n```\n",

        "content": "In order to replace the `type` parameter in your method with subclasses of `Employee`, you would need to define these subclasses first. Let's assume we have two types of employees - `Scammer` and `Programmer`. Here is how you can modify your code:\n\n```java\npublic Employee createEmployee(String name, String type) {\n    if (type.equals(\"scams\")) {\n        return new Scammer(name);\n    } else if (type.equals(\"programmers\")) {\n        return new Programmer(name);\n    } else {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Invalid employee type: \" + type);\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this code, `Scammer` and `Programmer` are subclasses of the `Employee` class. The method now creates instances of these subclasses based on the provided `type` parameter. If an invalid `type` is passed in, it throws an `IllegalArgumentException`. \n\nPlease note that you need to define classes `Scammer` and `Programmer` with constructors as per your requirement. The above code assumes a simple constructor for each of these subclasses where the name of the employee is provided. If they have different constructors, you would need to adjust this accordingly.\n",

It's not clear what \"sendBill()\" does, but assuming it sends an email or some other form of notification, you might want to separate that out into its own method as well.\n\nHere is how you could refactor your code:\n\n```java\npublic double getTotalOutstanding() {\n    double result = 0;\n    for (Invoice each : customer.getInvoices()) {\n        result += each.getAmount();\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n\npublic void sendBill() {\n    // Implementation of sending bill goes here\n}\n```\n\nNow, `getTotalOutstanding()` is a query method that calculates the total outstanding amount and `sendBill()` is a modifier method that sends a bill. You can call these methods as needed in your main code. \n\nFor example:\n\n```java\ndouble total = getTotalOutstanding();\nSystem.out.println(\"Total Outstanding: \" + total);\nsendBill(); // assuming sendBill() does something useful when called\n```\n",
