        "content": "It seems like you're trying to parse a string that contains both the name and price of an item, split them into separate strings, then use those strings to get the corresponding price from a map (priceList) and calculate the total order price. Here is how you can do it in Java:\n\n```java\nString[] orderData = orderString.split(\"\\\\s+\"); // Split by space(s)\nString[] productDetails = orderData[0].split(\"–\"); // Split by \"–\" to get name and id\nint quantity = Integer.parseInt(orderData[1]); // Get the quantity from the string\n\n// Assuming that priceList is a Map<String, Integer> where String is the product ID \n// and Integer is the corresponding price\nint productPrice = priceList.get(productDetails[1]); \n\nint orderPrice = quantity * productPrice; // Calculate total order price\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- `orderData` is an array of strings split by one or more spaces. The first element should contain the name and ID separated by \"–\", while the second element should contain the quantity.\n- `productDetails` is an array of strings obtained from splitting the first element of `orderData` by \"–\". It contains the product's name and its ID.\n- `quantity` is the number of items in the order, parsed from the string.\n- `productPrice` is fetched from `priceList` using the product's ID (the second element of `productDetails`).\n- Finally, `orderPrice` is calculated by multiplying `productPrice` with `quantity`. It represents the total price for this order. \n\nPlease replace `priceList` and `orderString` with your actual data. Also, make sure that the product ID exists in the `priceList` map to avoid a `NullPointerException`.\n",

Here is an example of how you can do it:\n\n```java\nint temp = 2 * (height + width); // First operation, storing result in temp\nSystem.out.println(temp); // Printing the value stored in temp\n\ntemp = height * width; // Second operation, updating the value of temp\nSystem.out.println(temp); // Printing the updated value of temp\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- `temp` is a temporary variable that stores intermediate results during the execution of your program. \n- The first line calculates `2 * (height + width)` and stores the result in `temp`. Then it prints out the value stored in `temp`.\n- The second line updates the value of `temp` to be the product of `height` and `width`, then it prints out the updated value of `temp`. \n\nThis is a common pattern in programming where you need to store intermediate results for later use or just print them out for debugging purposes.\n",
