        "content": "In order to replace the `type` parameter in your method with subclasses of `Employee` and name them as `doleBludger`, you would need to define these subclasses first. Let's assume we have two subclasses named `DoleBludger1` and `DoleBludger2` that extend the `Employee` class.\n\nHere is how your method could look like:\n\n```java\npublic Employee createEmployee(String name, String type) {\n    if (type.equals(\"doleBludger1\")) {\n        return new DoleBludger1(name);\n    } else if (type.equals(\"doleBludger2\")) {\n        return new DoleBludger2(name);\n    } else {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Invalid type: \" + type);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, `DoleBludger1` and `DoleBludger2` are subclasses of the `Employee` class. The constructor for these classes should take a name as an argument and call the superclass's constructor with that name. \n\nPlease note that you need to define these subclasses (`DoleBludger1`, `DoleBludger2`) in your code before using them here. This is just a basic example of how you can use subclasses based on the type parameter. You might want to adjust this according to your specific needs and classes structure.\n",
