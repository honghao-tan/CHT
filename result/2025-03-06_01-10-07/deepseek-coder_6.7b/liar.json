Here is how you can modify your code:\n\n```java\npublic Employee createEmployee(String name, String type) {\n    if (\"liar\".equalsIgnoreCase(type)) {\n        return new Liar(name);\n    } else {\n        return new Regular(name);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, `Liar` and `Regular` are subclasses of the `Employee` class. The method checks if the type is \"liar\", and if so, it creates a new instance of `Liar` with the given name. If not, it creates a new instance of `Regular` with the given name.\n\nPlease note that you need to define these subclasses (`Liar` and `Regular`) in your code before using them like this:\n\n```java\npublic class Employee {\n    private String name;\n    \n    public Employee(String name) {\n        this.name = name;\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Liar extends Employee {\n    public Liar(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Regular extends Employee {\n    public Regular(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n}\n```\n",

It's not clear what \"sendBill()\" does, but assuming it sends an email or some other form of notification, you might want to separate that out into its own method as well.\n\nHere is how you could refactor your code:\n\n```java\npublic double getTotalOutstanding() {\n    double result = 0;\n    for (Invoice each : customer.getInvoices()) {\n        result += each.getAmount();\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n\npublic void sendBill() {\n    // Implementation of sending bill goes here\n}\n```\n\nNow, `getTotalOutstanding()` is a query method that returns the total outstanding amount without sending a bill. The `sendBill()` method can be called separately to send a bill if needed. This way you separate the concerns clearly and adheres to good object-oriented design principles.\n",
