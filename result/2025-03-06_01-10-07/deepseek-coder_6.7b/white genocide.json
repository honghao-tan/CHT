The above code works, but it might not be idiomatic to JavaScript. \n\nIf you are using ES6 (JavaScript 2015), you can use `class` keyword and `extends`:\n```javascript\nclass whiteGenocide {\n    // ...\n}\n\nclass Stack extends whiteGenocide{\n   //...\n}\n```\nThis is more idiomatic to JavaScript. But if you insist on using a delegate-like pattern, the first code snippet should work for you.\n",
