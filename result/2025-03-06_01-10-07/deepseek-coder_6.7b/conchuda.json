The separation of concerns in object-oriented programming allows for better code organization, readability, and maintainability. \n\nHowever, if you want to name this method as `conchuda`, it's not recommended because it doesn't follow the conventional naming conventions in Java or most languages. It might be more appropriate to use a verb phrase like \"calculateTotalOutstanding\" or \"getTotalOutstanding\".\n\nHere is your original code:\n\n```java\npublic double getTotalOutstandingAndSendBill() {\n    double result = 0;\n    for (Invoice each : customer.getInvoices()) {\n        result += each.getAmount();\n    }\n    sendBill(); // Assuming this is a method that sends the bill\n    return result;\n}\n```\n\nIf you want to separate these two operations, you could create two different methods:\n\n```java\npublic double getTotalOutstanding() {\n    double result = 0;\n    for (Invoice each : customer.getInvoices()) {\n        result += each.getAmount();\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n\npublic void sendBill() {\n    // Code to send the bill goes here\n}\n```\n\nThen you can call these methods separately as needed:\n\n```java\ndouble totalOutstanding = getTotalOutstanding();\nsendBill();\n```\n",
