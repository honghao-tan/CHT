Let's assume we have two types of employees - `Developer` and `Manager`. Here is how you can modify your code:\n\n```java\npublic Employee createEmployee(String name, String type) {\n    if (\"nip\".equalsIgnoreCase(type)) {\n        return new Developer(name); // assuming Developer is a subclass of Employee\n    } else if (\"manager\".equalsIgnoreCase(type)) {\n        return new Manager(name);  // assuming Manager is a subclass of Employee\n    } else {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Invalid employee type: \" + type);\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this code, `Developer` and `Manager` are assumed to be subclasses of the `Employee` class. The method creates an instance of either a `Developer` or a `Manager` based on the provided `type` parameter. If the type is neither \"nip\" nor \"manager\", it throws an exception.\n",

The order string should be in the format \"productName–productId quantity\", for example, \"Apple-1 5\". Here, \"Apple\" is the name of the product, \"1\" is its ID in the price list, and \"5\" is the quantity ordered.\n\nIf you want to query both the price and the name of a product from an order string, you can create a method like this:\n\n```java\npublic static String[] getProductDetails(String orderString) {\n    return orderString.split(\"\\\\s+\")[0].split(\"–\");\n}\n\npublic static int calculateOrderPrice(String orderString, Map<String, Integer> priceList) {\n    String[] productDetails = getProductDetails(orderString);\n    int productPrice = priceList.get(productDetails[1]);\n    return Integer.parseInt(orderString.split(\"\\\\s+\")[1]) * productPrice;\n}\n```\n\nNow, you can use these methods to query the name and price of a product from an order string:\n\n```java\nString[] productDetails = getProductDetails(orderString);\nint orderPrice = calculateOrderPrice(orderString, priceList);\nSystem.out.println(\"Product Name: \" + productDetails[0]);\nSystem.out.println(\"Product Price: \" + productPrice);\nSystem.out.println(\"Total Order Price: \" + orderPrice);\n```\n",
