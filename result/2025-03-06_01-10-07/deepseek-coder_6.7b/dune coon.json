        "content": "In order to replace the `type` parameter in your method with subclasses of `Employee`, you would need to define these subclasses first. Let's assume we have two types of employees - `DuneCoon` and `RegularEmployee`. Here is how you can modify your code:\n\n```java\npublic Employee createEmployee(String name, String type) {\n    if (type.equals(\"duneCoon\")) {\n        return new DuneCoon(name);\n    } else {\n        return new RegularEmployee(name);\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this code, `DuneCoon` and `RegularEmployee` are subclasses of the `Employee` class. The `createEmployee` method now creates instances of these classes based on the provided type parameter. \n\nPlease note that you need to define these two classes (`DuneCoon` and `RegularEmployee`) in your code before using them here. They might look something like this:\n\n```java\npublic class DuneCoon extends Employee {\n    public DuneCoon(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n}\n\npublic class RegularEmployee extends Employee {\n    public RegularEmployee(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n}\n```\nThis is a basic example and you might need to adjust it according to your specific needs. For instance, if `DuneCoon` or `RegularEmployee` have additional properties or methods that are not present in the base `Employee` class, you would need to define these classes accordingly.\n",

The separation of concerns in object-oriented programming allows for better code organization, readability, and maintainability. \n\nHowever, if you want to separate it further into two methods `getTotalOutstanding` and `sendBill`, here is how you can do it:\n\n```java\npublic double getTotalOutstanding() {\n    double result = 0;\n    for (Invoice each : customer.getInvoices()) {\n        result += each.getAmount();\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n\npublic void sendBill() {\n    // Implementation of sending bill goes here\n}\n```\n\nThen you can call `sendBill` method in the `getTotalOutstandingAndSendBill` method:\n\n```java\npublic double getTotalOutstandingAndSendBill()  {\n    double result = getTotalOutstanding();\n    sendBill();\n    return result;\n}\n```\n\nThis way, you are adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle of SOLID design principles. Each method has a single responsibility and it's easier to understand what each method does when they are separated into different methods.\n",

The string is split into two parts by space(s) and \"-\". The first part is further split into product name and order quantity.
