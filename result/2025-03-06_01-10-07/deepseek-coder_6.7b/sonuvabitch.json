You can create different implementations of `Shipment` for different types of shipments (like Warehouse or PriorityPlan). \n\nThen in your code, you would initialize these delegates like this:\n```java\nOrder order = new Order();\norder._shipment = warehouse; // where 'warehouse' is an instance of a class implementing Shipment.\n\nPriorityOrder priorityOrder = new PriorityOrder();\npriorityOrder._priorityPlan = priorityPlan; // where 'priorityPlan' is an instance of a class implementing Shipment.\n```\nThis way, you have replaced the subclass with delegation and named it `sonuvabitch` (I assumed that was what you meant by \"delegate\" as there are no other meanings in your question). The main advantage of this approach is that it allows for more flexibility and easier testing. You can easily swap out the delegate at runtime without having to change any code that uses the `Order` or `PriorityOrder` classes.\n",

        "content": "In order to replace the `type` parameter in your method with subclasses of `Employee`, you would need to define these subclasses first. Let's assume we have two types of employees - `Developer` and `Manager`. Here is how you can modify your code:\n\n```java\npublic Employee createEmployee(String name, String type) {\n    if (\"developer\".equalsIgnoreCase(type)) {\n        return new Developer(name);\n    } else if (\"manager\".equalsIgnoreCase(type)) {\n        return new Manager(name);\n    } else {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Invalid employee type: \" + type);\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this code, `Developer` and `Manager` are subclasses of the `Employee` class. The method creates an instance of either a `Developer` or a `Manager` based on the value of the `type` parameter. If the `type` is neither \"developer\" nor \"manager\", it throws an `IllegalArgumentException`.\n\nPlease replace `Developer` and `Manager` with your actual subclasses if they are not named that way. Also, make sure to handle any other possible types of employees in a similar manner.\n",

The separation of concerns in object-oriented programming allows for better code organization. \n\nHowever, if you want to separate it further into two methods: one for getting the total outstanding amount and another for sending a bill, here's how you can do that:\n\n```java\npublic double getTotalOutstanding() {\n    double result = 0;\n    for (Invoice each : customer.getInvoices()) {\n        result += each.getAmount();\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n\npublic void sendBill() {\n    // Implementation of sending a bill goes here\n}\n```\n\nThen you can call `sendBill` method in the `getTotalOutstandingAndSendBill` method:\n\n```java\npublic double getTotalOutstandingAndSendBill()  {\n    double result = getTotalOutstanding();\n    sendBill();\n    return result;\n}\n```\n\nThis way, you have separated your concerns and made the code more readable. The `getTotalOutstanding` method is a query that returns the total outstanding amount without any side effects (like sending a bill), while the `sendBill` method is a modifier that performs an action but doesn't return anything.\n",

The string is split into two parts: one with the product details (name and ID), and another with the order quantity.\n\nThe product name and ID are then split again to get individual components, which are used as keys to retrieve the corresponding prices from `priceList`. Finally, the total price of the order is calculated by multiplying the quantity by the product's price. \n\nPlease replace \"productName\", \"productId\" and \"quantity\" with your actual values in the string and make sure that all these details are correct as per your requirement.\n",
