This can be achieved by modifying your `getName()` method in the Customer class.

Then in `getName()` method, we return \"occupant\" for any customer with a name of \"unknown\", otherwise we return their actual name. \n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that an empty string (\"\") should also be treated as unknown. If you want to avoid treating empty strings as known names, you can add another condition in the `Customer` constructor to set it to \"unknown\" if the trimmed version of the input is empty.\n",

        "content": "In order to replace the `type` parameter in your method with subclasses of `Employee`, you would need to define these subclasses first. Let's assume we have two types of employees - `TearType1` and `TearType2`. Here is how you can modify your code:\n\n```java\npublic Employee createEmployee(String name, String type) {\n    if (type.equals(\"tearing\")) {\n        return new Tearing(name);\n    } else {\n        // Assuming other types of employees are handled by a different class or method\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Invalid employee type: \" + type);\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this code, if the `type` parameter is equal to \"tearing\", it creates and returns an instance of `Tearing` (assuming you have a subclass named `Tearing` that extends from `Employee`). If the `type` parameter does not match any known type, it throws an `IllegalArgumentException`.\n\nPlease note that this is just a basic example. In real-world applications, you would likely have many more types of employees and handle them in different ways based on their type. This could involve creating subclasses for each employee type or using some kind of factory pattern to create the appropriate objects.\n",

The result is stored in the `orderData` array.\n\n2. `String[] productDetails = orderData[0].split(\"–\");` - This line further splits the first element of `orderData` (which should be a string containing product details) into an array of substrings, using the \"–\" character as delimiter. The result is stored in the `productDetails` array.\n\n3. `int productPrice = priceList.get(productDetails[1]);` - This line retrieves the price for the ordered item from the `priceList` map by using the second element of `productDetails` (which should be a key that corresponds to the desired price). The result is stored in the `productPrice` variable.\n\n4. `int orderPrice = Integer.parseInt(orderData[1]) * productPrice;` - This line calculates the total cost of the ordered item by multiplying the quantity (which should be a string that can be parsed into an integer) with the price per unit. The result is stored in the `orderPrice` variable.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that the input strings are well-formed and contain the expected data, and it doesn't handle potential exceptions or errors gracefully.
