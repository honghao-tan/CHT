        "content": "Your question seems to be related to object-oriented programming in Java, and it's not clear what you mean by \"separate the query from the modifier\". However, I can provide a suggestion based on your code. \n\nIf you want to separate the logic of getting total outstanding invoices from sending bills into two different methods, here is an example:\n\n```java\npublic class Customer {\n    // Assuming customer has a list of invoices\n    private List<Invoice> invoices;\n    \n    public double getTotalOutstanding() {\n        double result = 0;\n        for(Invoice each : this.invoices) {\n            result += each.getAmount();\n        }\n        return result;\n    }\n    \n    public void sendBill() {\n        // Logic to send bill goes here\n    }\n}\n```\nIn the above code, `getTotalOutstanding` is a query method that returns total outstanding amount and `sendBill` is a modifier method which sends bills. \n\nIf you want to call these methods from another class, you can do so like this:\n\n```java\nCustomer customer = new Customer();\ndouble totalOutstanding = customer.getTotalOutstanding();\ncustomer.sendBill();\n```\nThis way, the `getTotalOutstanding` method is only responsible for calculating the outstanding amount and not sending a bill, which makes it easier to test and maintain. The `sendBill` method can be tested separately as well. \n\nPlease provide more context if you need help with something else.\n",

However, I can give you a general example on how to split variable and use it in Java:\n\n```java\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int height = 5; // assuming the height of rectangle is 5 units\n        int width = 3; // assuming the width of rectangle is 3 units\n        \n        // Calculate perimeter and print it\n        int selfHarm = 2 * (height + width);\n        System.out.println(selfHarm);\n        \n        // Calculate area and print it\n        selfHarm = height * width;\n        System.out.println(selfHarm);\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this code, `selfHarm` is used as a variable to hold the result of the calculations. The first calculation (perimeter) assigns the result to `selfHarm` and then prints it out. The second calculation (area) does the same thing but with the area instead. \n\nPlease provide more context or details if you need a specific solution for your code.\n",
