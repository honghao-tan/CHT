In Java, the syntax for renaming a class would be to change the name of the file where it resides and then update all references to that class name throughout your project. However, if you want to rename \"Test\" to \"Program\", here are two ways:\n\n1. Rename the Class Name: \n```java\npublic class Program {\n    void test1() {\n        class Dummy {};\n        Dummy d = new Dummy();\n    }\n    \n    void test2() {\n        class Dummy {};\n        Dummy d = new Dummy();\n    }\n}\n```\n2. Rename the File: \nIf you're using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Eclipse or IntelliJ, renaming a file will automatically update all references to that class name in your project. If not, you would need to manually find and replace every occurrence of \"Test\" with \"Program\".\n\nPlease note: Java is case sensitive, so 'Test' and 'test' are different classes. \n\nAlso, if the code was part of a larger program or library, it may be necessary to update other parts of that project as well. Be sure to thoroughly test your changes after renaming them.\n",

        "content": "In order to replace the `type` parameter in your method with subclasses of `Employee`, you would need to define these subclasses first. Let's assume we have two types of employees - `Programmer` and `Tester`. Here is how you can modify your code:\n\n```java\npublic Employee createEmployee(String name, String type) {\n    if (\"programmer\".equalsIgnoreCase(type)) {\n        return new Programmer(name);\n    } else if (\"tester\".equalsIgnoreCase(type)) {\n        return new Tester(name);\n    } else {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Invalid employee type: \" + type);\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this code, `Programmer` and `Tester` are subclasses of the `Employee` class. The method creates an instance of either a `Programmer` or a `Tester` based on the value of the `type` parameter. If the `type` is neither \"programmer\" nor \"tester\", it throws an `IllegalArgumentException`.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes you have defined classes named `Programmer` and `Tester` in your project, which are subclasses of `Employee`. You would need to define these classes according to your specific requirements. \n\nAlso, the constructor for `Programmer` and `Tester` should take a name as an argument (or you can add more parameters if needed). For example:\n\n```java\npublic class Programmer extends Employee {\n    public Programmer(String name) {\n        super(name);  // Call to the constructor of the parent class (Employee)\n    }\n}\n```\n",

The first split by space or tab separates the name and price of the product from the quantity ordered. Then it splits the product name further at the '-' character. The product name is stored in `productName` variable, and its corresponding price (after converting to integer) is stored in `productPrice`. Finally, the total order price is calculated by multiplying the quantity of the product with its individual price.\n",
