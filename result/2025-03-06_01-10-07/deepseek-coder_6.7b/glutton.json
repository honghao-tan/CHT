Let's assume we have two types of employees - `Glutton` and `NonGlutton`. Here is how you can modify your code:\n\n```java\npublic Employee createEmployee(String name, String type) {\n    if (type.equals(\"glutton\")) {\n        return new Glutton(name);\n    } else {\n        return new NonGlutton(name);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, `Glutton` and `NonGlutton` are subclasses of the `Employee` class. The `createEmployee` method now returns an instance of either `Glutton` or `NonGlutton` based on the value of the `type` parameter.\n\nPlease note that you need to define these classes (`Glutton` and `NonGlutton`) in your code before using them here. The definitions for these classes would look something like this:\n\n```java\npublic class Glutton extends Employee {\n    public Glutton(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n}\n\npublic class NonGlutton extends Employee {\n    public NonGlutton(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis is a basic example and you might need to adjust it according to your specific needs. For instance, if `Employee` has other properties or methods that are not present in the subclasses, you would have to add them as well.\n",

The `sendBill` method can be used as a modifier to send a bill after calculating the total outstanding amount. This way, your code becomes more readable and maintainable.\n",

The string is split into two parts: the first part contains the name of the product and its price. Then, the price for that product is fetched from `priceList` using the product name. Finally, the total order price is calculated as the ordered quantity (which is assumed to be in `orderData[1]`) multiplied by the product's price.\n",
