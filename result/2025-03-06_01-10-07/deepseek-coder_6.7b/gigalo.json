Let's assume we have two types of employees - `Gigalo` and `Regular`.

The `createEmployee` method now creates instances of these subclasses based on the provided type parameter. If an invalid type is passed in, it throws an `IllegalArgumentException`.\n",

The separation of concerns in object-oriented programming allows for better code organization, readability, and maintainability. \n\nHowever, if you want to separate them further into two different methods `getTotalOutstanding()` and `sendBill()`, here is how it can be done:\n\n```java\npublic double getTotalOutstanding() {\n    double result = 0;\n    for (Invoice each : customer.getInvoices()) {\n        result += each.getAmount();\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n\npublic void sendBill() {\n    // Implementation of sending bill goes here\n}\n```\n\nThen you can call these methods as needed:\n\n```java\ndouble totalOutstanding = getTotalOutstanding();\nsendBill();\n```\n\nThis way, the `getTotalOutstanding` method is only responsible for calculating and returning the outstanding amount. The `sendBill` method is responsible for sending a bill. This adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) in object-oriented programming.\n",
