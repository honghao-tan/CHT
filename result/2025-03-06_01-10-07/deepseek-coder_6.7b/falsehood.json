This is similar to how delegates work in languages like C# or Java. \n\nPlease note that JavaScript does not have built-in support for classes (like other object-oriented programming languages), so you would need to define your objects and their methods manually, as shown above. Also, the `__proto__` property is non-standard but widely supported in modern browsers, while `Object.setPrototypeOf()` is a standard method that sets the prototype of an object.\n",

If it's greater, then `falsehood` will be set to 0.95; otherwise, it will be set to 0.98. Finally, we return the product of `basePrice` and `falsehood`.\n",
