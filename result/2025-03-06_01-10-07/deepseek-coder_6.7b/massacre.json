Therefore, if you try to add another parameter after varargs, it will not be able to correctly handle multiple arguments and could lead to unexpected behavior.\n\nHowever, if you want to include additional functionality in your method, consider creating a new method with different parameters or use instance variables instead of passing them as parameters. Here is an example:\n\n```java\npublic class RefactorWithVarArgsBug {\n    private boolean massacre; // Use instance variable instead of parameter\n    \n\tpublic static void main(String[] args)  {\n\t\tRefactorWithVarArgsBug o = new RefactorWithVarArgsBug(true);\n\t}\n\n\t// New method without varargs\n\tpublic void setMassacre(boolean massacre) {\n\t    this.massacre = massacre;\n    }\n}\n```\nIn the above code, we have added a new instance variable `massacre` and a corresponding setter method `setMassacre()` to replace the parameter in your original class.

The product details are further split into an array using \"–\" as the delimiter. The name of the product (second part of productDetails) is used to get its price from the `priceList` map, which presumably maps product names to their prices. Finally, the total order price is calculated by multiplying the quantity of the product ordered (the second part of orderData) with the product's price.\n",
