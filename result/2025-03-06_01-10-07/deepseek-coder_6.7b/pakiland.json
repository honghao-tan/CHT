        "content": "In order to replace the `type` parameter in your method with subclasses of `Employee`, you would need to define these subclasses first. Let's assume we have two types of employees: `Developer` and `Tester`. Here is how you can modify your code:\n\n```java\npublic Employee createEmployee(String name, String type) {\n    if (\"developer\".equalsIgnoreCase(type)) {\n        return new Developer(name);\n    } else if (\"tester\".equalsIgnoreCase(type)) {\n        return new Tester(name);\n    } else {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Invalid employee type: \" + type);\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this code, `Developer` and `Tester` are subclasses of the `Employee` class. The method creates an instance of either a `Developer` or a `Tester` based on the value of the `type` parameter. If the type is neither \"developer\" nor \"tester\", it throws an exception.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes you have defined classes named `Developer` and `Tester` which are subclasses of `Employee` class in your project. You need to replace these with actual names of your subclasses if they're different. \n\nAlso, the constructor for each of these subclasses should take a single String parameter (the name) as per your original code. If it needs more parameters, you would have to adjust this accordingly.\n",

The separation of concerns in object-oriented programming allows for better code organization, readability, and maintainability. \n\nHowever, if you want to separate the query from the modifier even further, you could create two different methods: one for calculating the total outstanding amount and another for sending a bill. Here's how you might do it:\n\n```java\npublic double getTotalOutstanding() {\n    double result = 0;\n    for (Invoice each : customer.getInvoices()) {\n        result += each.getAmount();\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n\npublic void sendBill() {\n    // Code to send bill goes here\n}\n```\n\nThen, you can call `sendBill` method in the `getTotalOutstandingAndSendBill` method:\n\n```java\npublic double getTotalOutstandingAndSendBill()  {\n    double result = getTotalOutstanding();\n    sendBill();\n    return result;\n}\n```\n\nThis way, you're still following the principle of separation of concerns. The `getTotalOutstanding` method is only responsible for calculating the total outstanding amount, and the `sendBill` method is only responsible for sending a bill.

The result is stored in the `orderData` array.\n\n2. `String[] productDetails = orderData[0].split(\"–\");` - This line splits the first element of `orderData` into an array of substrings based on the \"–\" delimiter. It's assumed that this is a hyphen-minus character, not to be confused with \"-\". The result is stored in the `productDetails` array.\n\n3. `int productPrice = priceList.get(productDetails[1]);` - This line retrieves the price of the ordered item from the `priceList` map using the second element of `productDetails` as a key. It assumes that the keys in `priceList` are strings and correspond to the names of items, not their IDs or similar identifiers.\n\n4. `int orderPrice = Integer.parseInt(orderData[1]) * productPrice;` - This line calculates the total price for the ordered item by multiplying the quantity (which is parsed from the second element of `orderData`) with the unit price (`productPrice`). The result is stored in the `orderPrice` integer.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes a specific format for the input string and the structure of the `priceList` map, which might not be suitable for all use cases.
