It's good practice to separate these into different methods for better code organization and readability. Here is how you can do it:\n\n```java\npublic double getTotalOutstanding() {\n    double result = 0;\n    for (Invoice each : customer.getInvoices()) {\n        result += each.getAmount();\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n\npublic void sendBill() {\n    // Implementation of sending bill goes here\n}\n```\n\nNow, you can call `sendBill()` method in the `getTotalOutstandingAndSendBill()`:\n\n```java\npublic double getTotalOutstandingAndSendBill()  {\n    double result = getTotalOutstanding();\n    sendBill();\n    return result;\n}\n```\n\nThis way, you have separated query (calculating total outstanding) and modifier (sending bill), each in their own method. This makes your code easier to read and maintain.\n",
