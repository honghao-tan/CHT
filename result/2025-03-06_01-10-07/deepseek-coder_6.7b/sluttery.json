However, I can show you how to rename the class \"Test\" to something else such as \"Sluttery\".\n\n```java\npublic class Test { // original name\n    void test1() \n    {\n        class Dummy {};\n        Dummy d = new Dummy();\n    }\n    \n    void test2() \n    {\n        class Dummy {};\n        Dummy d = new Dummy();\n    }\n}\n```\nTo rename the class to \"Sluttery\", you would need to create a new file with that name and move your code into it. Then, in the package declaration at the top of the file (if any), change `package test;` to `package slutter;` or whatever package structure you want.\n\n```java\npublic class Sluttery { // renamed name\n    void test1() \n    {\n        class Dummy {};\n        Dummy d = new Dummy();\n    }\n    \n    void test2() \n    {\n        class Dummy {};\n        Dummy d = new Dummy();\n    }\n}\n```\nPlease note that Java is case sensitive, so \"Test\" and \"test\" would be different classes. Also, the original class name \"Test\" should not be used elsewhere in your codebase as it will cause a compile error if you try to use it again. \n\nIf you're using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA, they usually provide easy ways to refactor code including renaming classes.\n",

The `equalsIgnoreCase` method is used for case insensitive comparison of strings. \n\nPlease note that this solution assumes you want to handle the special case at the time of object creation (when a new Customer is created).

        "content": "In order to replace the `type` parameter in your method with subclasses of `Employee`, you would need to define these subclasses first. Let's assume we have two types of employees - `Manager` and `Developer`. Here is how you can refactor your code:\n\n```java\npublic Employee createEmployee(String name, String type) {\n    if (\"manager\".equalsIgnoreCase(type)) {\n        return new Manager(name);\n    } else if (\"developer\".equalsIgnoreCase(type)) {\n        return new Developer(name);\n    } else {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Invalid employee type: \" + type);\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this code, `Manager` and `Developer` are subclasses of the `Employee` class. The method creates an instance of a specific subclass based on the provided `type` parameter. If the `type` is not recognized, it throws an exception. \n\nPlease note that in Java, naming conventions typically use CamelCase for classes and methods (e.g., `createEmployee`), so you might want to rename your method to something like `createEmployeeFromType` or similar. Also, the type parameter should be an enum instead of a string if possible, as it provides compile-time safety.\n",

The `sendBill` method can be used as a modifier to perform some action (like sending a bill) after calculating the total outstanding amount. \n\nPlease note that in Java, methods should ideally do one thing and do it well. So if you have more complex logic for sending bills or handling invoices, consider breaking them into separate methods. This makes your code easier to read, test, and maintain.\n",
