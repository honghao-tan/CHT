They are separate from each other and can be used independently as per your requirements. \n\nPlease replace the comment \"// Implementation of sending bill goes here\" with actual implementation of sending bill.\n",

It splits the string into parts based on spaces or dashes, checks if the resulting parts are valid, queries the price from the list, calculates the total order price, and prints it out.\n",
