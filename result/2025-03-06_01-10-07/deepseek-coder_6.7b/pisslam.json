        "content": "Your question seems to be related to object-oriented programming in Java. Here's how you can refactor your code using subclasses and naming them as \"Pisslam\":\n\nFirstly, create a base class `Employee` with the constructor that takes name and type parameters:\n```java\npublic abstract class Employee {\n    private String name;\n    private String type;\n    \n    public Employee(String name, String type) {\n        this.name = name;\n        this.type = type;\n    }\n}\n```\nThen create subclasses for each specific employee type:\n```java\npublic class Pisslam extends Employee {\n    public Pisslam(String name) {\n        super(name, \"Pisslam\");\n    }\n}\n```\nFinally, modify your `createEmployee` method to return a subclass instance based on the type parameter:\n```java\npublic Employee createEmployee(String name, String type)  {\n    if (\"Pisslam\".equalsIgnoreCase(type)) {\n        return new Pisslam(name);\n    } else {\n        // Handle other types of employees here...\n    }\n}\n```\nThis way, you can create different types of employees by extending the `Employee` class and providing a specific implementation for each subclass. The `createEmployee` method will return an instance of the appropriate subclass based on the type parameter.\n",
