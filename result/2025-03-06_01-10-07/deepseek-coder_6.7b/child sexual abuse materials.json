        "content": "Your question seems to be related to object-oriented programming in Java. However, it's not clear what the `type` parameter represents and how you want to use it. Assuming that `type` is used to determine which subclass of `Employee` should be created (for example, if there are different types of employees like 'Manager', 'Engineer', etc.), here's a simple way to do this:\n\n```java\npublic Employee createEmployee(String name, String type) {\n    switch(type) {\n        case \"Manager\":\n            return new Manager(name);\n        case \"Engineer\":\n            return new Engineer(name);\n        // Add more cases as needed for other types of employees\n        default:\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Invalid employee type\");\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this example, `Manager` and `Engineer` are subclasses of `Employee`. You would need to define these classes somewhere in your code. \n\nPlease note that the above solution is a simple one and might not fit into complex scenarios where you have many types of employees or different behaviors for each type. In such cases, you may want to use factory pattern or some other design patterns.\n",

        "content": "It seems like you are trying to separate the query (retrieving data) from the modifier (changing or updating data). In your case, it appears that you're retrieving invoices and summing their amounts. \n\nHere is a way to do this using Java:\n\n```java\npublic class Customer {\n    // Assuming Invoice class has getAmount() method\n    \n    private List<Invoice> invoices;\n\n    public double getTotalOutstanding() {\n        double result = 0;\n        for (Invoice each : this.invoices) {\n            result += each.getAmount();\n        }\n        return result;\n    }\n    \n    // Assuming sendBill is a method that sends the bill to customer\n    public void sendBill() {\n        // Logic for sending bill goes here\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this code, `getTotalOutstanding` is a query method which returns total outstanding amount. It doesn't modify any data but simply retrieves it. The `sendBill` method can be considered as the modifier in your case because it changes some state of an object (sends bill to customer).\n\nPlease note that you need to initialize the invoices list before using this code, and Invoice class should have a getAmount() method which returns amount for each invoice. \n\nAlso, if `sendBill` is not supposed to be part of Customer class but rather it's an independent function or method, then you can remove that from the above code. It depends on your actual requirement and design of your application.\n",
