        "content": "Your method `getTotalOutstandingAndSendBill()` is already separated into a query (retrieving the total outstanding amount) and a modifier (sending a bill). The separation of concerns in object-oriented programming allows for better code organization, readability, and maintainability. \n\nHowever, if you want to separate them further into two different methods, one for retrieving the data (query), and another for sending the bill (modifier), here's how you can do it:\n\n```java\npublic double getTotalOutstanding() {\n    double result = 0;\n    for(Invoice each : customer.getInvoices()) {\n        result += each.getAmount();\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n\npublic void sendBill() {\n    // Code to send bill goes here\n}\n```\n\nNow, you can call `sendBill()` method whenever you need to send a bill and get the total outstanding amount by calling `getTotalOutstanding()`. This way, your code is more modular and easier to understand. \n\nPlease note that in Java, methods should be named according to their functionality, not according to how they are used (like \"shiner\"). So you might want to rename the method names for better understanding of what each does.\n",
