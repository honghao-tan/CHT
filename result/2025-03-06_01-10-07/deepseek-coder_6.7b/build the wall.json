        "content": "In order to replace the `type` parameter in your method with subclasses of `Employee`, you would need to define these subclasses first. Let's assume we have two types of employees - `WallBuilder` and `GeneralEmployee`. Here is how you can modify your code:\n\n```java\npublic Employee createEmployee(String name, String type) {\n    if (type.equals(\"buildTheWall\")) {\n        return new WallBuilder(name);\n    } else {\n        return new GeneralEmployee(name);\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this code, `\"buildTheWall\"` is used to create a `WallBuilder` object. If the type is not \"buildTheWall\", it creates a `GeneralEmployee` object. \n\nPlease note that you need to define classes `WallBuilder` and `GeneralEmployee` in your code, which should extend from `Employee` class. Here's an example of how these subclasses might look:\n\n```java\npublic class WallBuilder extends Employee {\n    public WallBuilder(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n    \n    // Additional methods specific to WallBuilder go here\n}\n\npublic class GeneralEmployee extends Employee {\n    public GeneralEmployee(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n    \n    // Additional methods specific to GeneralEmployee go here\n}\n```\nThis way, you can create different types of employees based on the type parameter.\n",
