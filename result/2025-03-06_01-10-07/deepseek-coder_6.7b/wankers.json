        "content": "In order to replace the `type` parameter in your method with subclasses of `Employee`, you would need to define these subclasses first. Let's assume we have two types of employees - `Developer` and `Manager`. Here is how you can modify your code:\n\n```java\npublic Employee createEmployee(String name, String type) {\n    if (\"developer\".equalsIgnoreCase(type)) {\n        return new Developer(name);\n    } else if (\"manager\".equalsIgnoreCase(type)) {\n        return new Manager(name);\n    } else {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Invalid employee type: \" + type);\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this code, `Developer` and `Manager` are subclasses of the `Employee` class. The method creates an instance of a specific subclass based on the provided `type` parameter. If the `type` is not recognized, it throws an exception. \n\nPlease note that in Java, naming conventions typically use CamelCase for classes and methods (e.g., `createEmployee`), so you might want to rename your method to something like `createEmployeeFromType` or similar. Also, the type parameter should be an enum instead of a string if possible, as it provides compile-time safety.\n",

This way, your code is more modular and easier to understand. \n\nPlease replace the comment inside `sendBill()` with the actual implementation of sending a bill.\n",
