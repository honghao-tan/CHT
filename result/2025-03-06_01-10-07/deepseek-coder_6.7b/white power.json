The `switch` statement replaces the original switch-case, and each case creates a new instance of the corresponding Bird class with its own specific behavior. This way, we avoid using conditional statements to determine which type of bird we're dealing with, and instead use polymorphism to delegate the work to the appropriate method in each subclass.\n",

        "content": "Your question seems to be related to object-oriented programming in Java, and it's about separating the query (retrieving data) from the modifier (changing state or behavior). Here is how you can do this:\n\n```java\npublic class Customer {\n    // Assuming customer has a list of invoices\n    private List<Invoice> invoices; \n    \n    public double getTotalOutstanding() {\n        double result = 0;\n        for (Invoice each : invoices) {\n            result += each.getAmount();\n        }\n        return result;\n    }\n    \n    // Assuming sendBill is a method that sends the bill to customer\n    public void sendBill() { \n        // Code to send bill goes here\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this code, `getTotalOutstanding` is a query method which retrieves data (total outstanding amount) and `sendBill` is a modifier method that changes the state of the object. They are separated as per your requirement. \n\nPlease note that you need to replace the comments with actual implementation based on your application's requirements. Also, make sure to initialize the invoices list before using it in getTotalOutstanding method.\n",
