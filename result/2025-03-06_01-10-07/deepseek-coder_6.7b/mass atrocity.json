        "content": "In JavaScript, we can use delegation (or composition) to achieve this. We will create an instance of the `List` class and assign it as a delegate for the `Stack` class. Here is how you could do that:\n\n```javascript\nclass List {\n    constructor() {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n\nclass Stack {\n    constructor(list) {\n        this._list = list;\n        // ...\n    }\n    \n    // Forward methods to delegate object\n    method1() { return this._list.method1(); }\n    method2() { return this._list.method2(); }\n    // etc...\n}\n```\nIn the above code, `Stack` is a subclass of `List` that uses composition to use an instance of `List` as its delegate. This way, you can replace the superclass with a delegate and name it `massAtrocity`:\n\n```javascript\nlet massAtrocity = new List();\nlet stackInstance = new Stack(massAtrocity);\n```\nIn this example, `stackInstance` is an instance of `Stack` that uses `massAtrocity` as its delegate. You can call methods on `stackInstance` just like you would with a regular `List` object. \n\nPlease note that the above code assumes that `List` class has methods (like method1, method2 etc.) which are being forwarded to the delegate in `Stack` class. If not, we need to define those methods in `List` and then call them from `Stack` using this delegation mechanism.\n",
