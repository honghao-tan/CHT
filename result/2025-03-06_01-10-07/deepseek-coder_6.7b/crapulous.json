It's not clear what \"crapulous\" means in this context, but assuming you want to separate these two operations into different methods for clarity, here is how you could do it:\n\n```java\npublic double getTotalOutstanding() {\n    double result = 0;\n    for (Invoice each : customer.getInvoices()) {\n        result += each.getAmount();\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n\npublic void sendBill() {\n    // Implementation of sending bill goes here\n}\n```\n\nNow, you can call `getTotalOutstanding` to get the total outstanding amount and `sendBill` to send a bill. This way, your method is more focused on one task at a time, making it easier to understand and maintain. \n\nPlease note that if \"crapulous\" means something else in your context, you might need to adjust this code accordingly.\n",
