Let's assume we have two types of employees - `Developer` and `Manager`.

The method creates an instance of a specific subclass based on the provided `type` parameter. If the `type` is not recognized, it throws an `IllegalArgumentException`. \n\nPlease note that this code assumes you have defined classes named `Developer` and `Manager` in your project. You would need to define these classes according to your specific requirements.\n",
