        "content": "In order to replace the \"type\" parameter in your `createEmployee` method with subclasses of `Employee`, you would need to define these subclasses first. Let's assume we have two types of employees - `RentBoy` and `RegularEmployee`:\n\n```java\npublic class RentBoy extends Employee {\n    public RentBoy(String name) {\n        super(name, \"RentBoy\");\n    }\n}\n\npublic class RegularEmployee extends Employee {\n    public RegularEmployee(String name) {\n        super(name, \"RegularEmployee\");\n    }\n}\n```\nThen you can modify your `createEmployee` method to return an instance of the appropriate subclass:\n\n```java\npublic Employee createEmployee(String name, String type)  {\n    if (type.equals(\"RentBoy\")) {\n        return new RentBoy(name);\n    } else if (type.equals(\"RegularEmployee\")) {\n        return new RegularEmployee(name);\n    } else {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Invalid employee type: \" + type);\n    }\n}\n```\nThis way, you can create instances of `RentBoy` or `RegularEmployee` by passing their respective types to the `createEmployee` method. If an invalid type is passed, it will throw an exception.\n",
