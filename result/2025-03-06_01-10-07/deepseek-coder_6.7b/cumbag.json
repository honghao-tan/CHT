        "content": "Your question seems to be related to object-oriented programming in Java. However, it's not clear what the `type` parameter is supposed to represent. Assuming that you have subclasses of `Employee` for different types of employees (e.g., `Manager`, `Engineer`, etc.), and these classes are defined somewhere else in your code, here's how you could refactor your method:\n\n```java\npublic Employee createEmployee(String name, String type) {\n    switch (type) {\n        case \"manager\":\n            return new Manager(name);\n        case \"engineer\":\n            return new Engineer(name);\n        // Add more cases for other types of employees...\n        default:\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Invalid employee type: \" + type);\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this code, `Manager` and `Engineer` are assumed to be subclasses of `Employee`. The switch statement is used to create the appropriate type of employee based on the `type` parameter. If an invalid `type` is passed in, an exception is thrown. \n\nPlease replace \"manager\" and \"engineer\" with your actual types or classes that extend from Employee class. Also, make sure you have defined these subclasses (Manager and Engineer) somewhere else in your code.\n",

The `getTotalOutstanding` method now only calculates and returns the total outstanding amount. The `sendBill()` method is responsible for sending the bill. \n\nPlease note that this refactoring assumes that you have an instance variable named `customer` of type `Customer`, which has a method `getInvoices()` returning a list of invoices associated with the customer. Also, it's assumed that each Invoice object has a method `getAmount()` to get its outstanding amount.\n",
