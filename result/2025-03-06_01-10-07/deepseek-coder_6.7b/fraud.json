After that, change all occurrences of \"Test\" in the copied code to \"Fraud\". \n\nHere's what it would look like:\n```java\npublic class Fraud { // This is your renamed class name\n    void test1() {\n        class Dummy {}\n        Dummy d = new Dummy();\n    }\n    \n    void test2() {\n        class Dummy {}\n        Dummy d = new Dummy();\n    }\n}\n```\nPlease note that this is a simple renaming and doesn't involve any compilation or build process. If you are using an IDE, it might offer some features to assist with refactoring like renaming classes. \n\nAlso, please remember Java is case-sensitive so \"Test\" and \"Fraud\" would be considered different names in this context.\n",

It's not clear what \"sendBill()\" does, but assuming it sends an email or some other form of notification, you might want to separate that out into its own method as well.\n\nHere is how you could refactor your code:\n\n```java\npublic double getTotalOutstanding() {\n    double result = 0;\n    for (Invoice each : customer.getInvoices()) {\n        result += each.getAmount();\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n\npublic void sendBill() {\n    // Implementation of sending bill goes here\n}\n```\n\nNow, `getTotalOutstanding()` is a query method that calculates the total outstanding amount and `sendBill()` is a modifier method that sends a bill. You can call these methods as needed in your main code. \n\nFor example:\n\n```java\ndouble total = getTotalOutstanding();\nSystem.out.println(\"Total Outstanding: \" + total);\nsendBill(); // assuming sendBill() does something useful when called\n```\n",

However, your code snippet is missing some context or details about how `priceList` is defined or what the format of `orderString` is.\n\nHere's a general example of how you might do this:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.*;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Assuming orderString in the format \"ProductName–ProductId\" and priceList is a Map<String, Integer> where ProductId maps to its price\n        String orderString = \"Product1–P001\";\n        List<String> priceList = Arrays.asList(\"P001:5\", \"P002:10\", \"P003:15\"); // assuming prices are in the format \"ProductId:Price\"\n        \n        String[] orderData = orderString.split(\"\\\\s+\");\n        String[] productDetails = orderData[0].split(\"–\");\n        \n        Optional<String> priceOpt = priceList.stream()\n            .filter(p -> p.startsWith(productDetails[1])) // find the correct price for this product\n            .findFirst();\n            \n        if (priceOpt.isPresent()) {\n            String[] priceData = priceOpt.get().split(\":\");\n            int productPrice = Integer.parseInt(priceData[1]);\n            int orderPrice = Integer.parseInt(orderData[1]) * productPrice;\n            \n            System.out.println(\"Order Price: \" + orderPrice);\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"Product not found in price list\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code assumes that the `priceList` is a List of Strings where each string starts with the product id and followed by its price, separated by \":\". The orderString should be in the format \"quantity ProductName–ProductId\", where quantity is an integer. \n\nPlease replace these assumptions with your actual data structure and format if they are different.\n",

We calculate two values (the sum of `height` and `width` multiplied by 2, and the product of `height` and `width`) and print them out. After calculating the second value, we store it in `temp` again.\n",
