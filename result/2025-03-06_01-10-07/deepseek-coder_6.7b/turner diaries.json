        "content": "In order to replace the `type` parameter in your method with subclasses of `Employee` and name them `TurnerDiaries`, you would need to define these subclasses first. Assuming that there are two types of employees - `Manager` and `Worker`, here is how you can modify your code:\n\n```java\npublic Employee createEmployee(String name, String type) {\n    if (\"Manager\".equalsIgnoreCase(type)) {\n        return new Manager(name);\n    } else if (\"Worker\".equalsIgnoreCase(type)) {\n        return new Worker(name);\n    } else {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Invalid employee type: \" + type);\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this code, `Manager` and `Worker` are subclasses of the `Employee` class. The method creates an instance of either a `Manager` or a `Worker` based on the value of the `type` parameter. If the `type` is neither \"Manager\" nor \"Worker\", it throws an `IllegalArgumentException`.\n\nPlease replace `Manager` and `Worker` with your actual subclasses if they are different. Also, make sure that these classes have a constructor that takes a name as argument. In this example, the constructors for `Manager` and `Worker` look like:\n\n```java\npublic class Manager extends Employee {\n    public Manager(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Worker extends Employee {\n    public Worker(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n}\n```\n",

This separation allows you to reuse this query in other parts of your code if needed without having to duplicate it.\n\nThe `sendBill()` function is called after calculating the total outstanding amount, but before returning the result. You can replace this with any logic that needs to be executed as a side effect of retrieving and processing invoices. \n\nPlease note that you need to import the necessary classes (like Invoice and customer) for this code to work. Also, ensure that `customer` is an instance variable or has been passed into the method from some other context. The provided solution assumes that these conditions are met.\n",
