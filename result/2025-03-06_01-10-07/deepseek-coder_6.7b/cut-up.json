This makes your code more readable and maintainable.\n",

The first part of `orderString` should be in the format \"productName-productId quantity\". This is then split by \"-\" and the second part (which should be a productId) is used to get the price from the `priceList`.\n\nThe total order price is calculated as the number of items ordered (from `orderData[1]`) multiplied by the product's price. \n\nPlease replace \"productName\", \"productId\", \"quantity\" and \"priceList\" with your actual data.
