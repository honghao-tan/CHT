Let's assume we have two types of employees - `Gorger` and `OtherType`. Here is how you can modify your code:\n\n```java\npublic Employee createEmployee(String name, String type) {\n    if (type.equals(\"gorger\")) {\n        return new Gorger(name);\n    } else {\n        return new OtherType(name);\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this code, `Gorger` and `OtherType` are subclasses of the `Employee` class. The method now creates an instance of either a `Gorger` or an `OtherType` based on the value of the `type` parameter. \n\nPlease note that you need to define these classes (`Gorger` and `OtherType`) in your code before using them here. They should look something like this:\n\n```java\npublic class Gorger extends Employee {\n    public Gorger(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n}\n\npublic class OtherType extends Employee {\n    public OtherType(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code assumes that the `Employee` class has a constructor that takes a `name` parameter. If it doesn't, you will need to add one. \n\nAlso, please note that this is just an example and might not fit your exact needs. You should adjust the classes and method according to your specific requirements.\n",

The `sendBill` method can be used as a modifier to send a bill after calculating the total outstanding amount. \n\nPlease replace the comment with your actual logic for sending bills.\n",
