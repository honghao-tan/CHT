However, I can provide an example of how you might rename \"Test\" to \"Spicspeak\".\n\n```java\npublic class Test { // This is your original class\n    void test1() \n    {\n        class Dummy {}\n        Dummy d = new Dummy();\n    }\n    \n    void test2() \n    {\n        class Dummy {}\n        Dummy d = new Dummy();\n    }\n}\n```\nTo rename \"Test\" to \"Spicspeak\", you would need to create a new file named \"Spicspeak.java\". Then, in that file, you could define your class like this:\n\n```java\npublic class Spicspeak { // This is the renamed class\n    void test1() \n    {\n        class Dummy {}\n        Dummy d = new Dummy();\n    }\n    \n    void test2() \n    {\n        class Dummy {}\n        Dummy d = new Dummy();\n    }\n}\n```\nPlease note that this is a simple renaming and doesn't involve any significant changes to the code. If you need more complex refactoring, such as moving methods or classes around, you would likely use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) with built-in support for Java development, like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.\n",

Let's assume we have two types of employees - `Manager` and `Worker`.

The method creates an instance of either a `Manager` or a `Worker` based on the value of the `type` parameter. If the `type` is neither \"manager\" nor \"worker\", it throws an exception.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes you have defined classes named `Manager` and `Worker` in your program. You would need to define these classes according to your specific requirements. \n\nAlso, please be aware that using a string comparison (`type.equals(\"manager\")`) is case sensitive. If you want it to be case insensitive, use `type.equalsIgnoreCase(\"manager\")` instead.\n",

The `priceList` needs to be populated with prices for each product. \n\nThe first line splits the order data into two parts: the product details (name and ID) and the quantity of that product ordered. Then it gets the price of the product from the `priceList` using the product's ID, and calculates the total price of the order by multiplying the quantity by the product's price.\n",
