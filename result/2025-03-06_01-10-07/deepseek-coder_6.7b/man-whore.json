        "content": "Your question seems to be related to object-oriented programming in Java. Here's how you can refactor your code using subclasses and named them as \"ManWhore\":\n\nFirstly, create a superclass called `Employee` with the constructor that takes name and type parameters:\n\n```java\npublic class Employee {\n    private String name;\n    private String type;\n    \n    public Employee(String name, String type) {\n        this.name = name;\n        this.type = type;\n    }\n}\n```\nThen create a subclass called `ManWhore`:\n\n```java\npublic class ManWhore extends Employee{\n    \n    public ManWhore(String name, String type) {\n        super(name, type);\n    }\n}\n```\nFinally, modify your method to return an instance of the subclass `ManWhore` instead of `Employee`:\n\n```java\npublic Employee createEmployee(String name, String type)  {\n    if (type.equals(\"manWhore\")) {\n        return new ManWhore(name, type);\n    } else {\n        return new Employee(name, type);\n    }\n}\n```\nThis way, you can create instances of `ManWhore` by calling the method with \"manWhore\" as the type parameter. For all other types, it will return an instance of `Employee`. \n\nPlease note that this is a simple example and real-world scenarios might require more complex design patterns like Factory pattern or Abstract factory pattern to create objects based on different conditions.\n",

The result of this query is then passed as an argument to `sendBill()`, which handles sending the bill (but does not return anything in this example).\n\nPlease replace the `sendBill(double total)` method with your own implementation that suits your needs. This way you separate the logic for getting and setting data into two different methods.\n",
