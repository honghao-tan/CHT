Here is how you can modify your code:\n\n```java\npublic Employee createEmployee(String name, String type) {\n    if (\"manager\".equalsIgnoreCase(type)) {\n        return new Manager(name);\n    } else if (\"worker\".equalsIgnoreCase(type)) {\n        return new Worker(name);\n    } else {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Invalid employee type: \" + type);\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this code, `Manager` and `Worker` are subclasses of the `Employee` class. The method creates an instance of either a `Manager` or a `Worker` based on the value of the `type` parameter. If the `type` is neither \"manager\" nor \"worker\", it throws an `IllegalArgumentException`.\n\nPlease replace `Manager` and `Worker` with your actual subclasses if they are different. Also, make sure to handle any other possible types in a similar way.\n",

        "content": "Your method `getTotalOutstandingAndSendBill()` is a bit confusing as it both queries (gets the total outstanding amount) and modifies (sends a bill). It's better to separate these two operations. Here's how you can do that:\n\n```java\npublic double getTotalOutstanding() {\n    double result = 0;\n    for(Invoice each : customer.getInvoices()) {\n        result += each.getAmount();\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n\npublic void sendBill() {\n    // Implementation of sending bill goes here\n}\n```\n\nNow, `getTotalOutstanding()` is a query method that returns the total outstanding amount without modifying anything. The `sendBill()` method can be used as a modifier to send a bill after calculating the total outstanding amount. \n\nPlease replace the comment with your actual implementation of sending a bill.\n",
