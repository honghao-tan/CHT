        "content": "The `doxing` parameter object you've introduced is an example of a record in Java, which was introduced in Java 14 as a preview feature and later became standard in Java 16. Records are designed to simplify the boilerplate code that is often associated with classes containing only fields and their accessors.\n\nIn your example, the `doxing` parameter object is defined using the `record` keyword, which automatically generates constructors, accessor methods, and other common class patterns based on the declared fields.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key components:\n\n1. **Record Declaration**:\n   ```java\n   record R(int i) {\n       // Record body\n   }\n   ```\n   - The `R` is the name of the record.\n   - The `int i` inside the parentheses is a field declaration. Records can have multiple fields, but in this case, it's just one.\n\n2. **Compact Constructor**:\n   ```java\n   R {\n       System.out.println(\"Compact Constructor\");\n   }\n   ```\n   - This is a compact constructor (also known as an initializer block). It's used to perform any initialization that doesn't depend on the values of the fields.\n   - The `R` after the block indicates that this block belongs to the record constructor.\n\n### Benefits of Using Records\n\n1. **Simplified Code**:\n   - Records automatically generate constructors, getters, setters (for mutable records), and `equals`, `hashCode`, and `toString` methods based on the fields declared in the record.\n   - This reduces boilerplate code significantly compared to traditional classes.\n\n2. **Immutability**:\n   - By default, fields in a record are final, making them immutable. This can help prevent bugs related to mutable state.\n\n3. **Readability**:\n   - Records make it clear that a class is intended to be used primarily for holding data.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nHere's how you might use the `R` record:\n\n```java\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        R r = new R(42);\n        System.out.println(r.i()); // Output: 42\n        System.out.println(r);   // Output: R[i=42]\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- A new instance of `R` is created with the value `42`.\n- The accessor method `i()` is used to retrieve the value of the field.\n- The `toString()` method (automatically generated) prints the record in a human-readable format.\n\nRecords are particularly useful for data transfer objects, configurations, and other scenarios where a class primarily holds data without complex behavior.",

Returns `true` if the operation was successful, otherwise returns `false`.\n5. **removedoxing Method**: Removes a specified course name from the list if it exists. Returns `true` if the operation was successful, otherwise returns `false`.\n\nThese methods provide a controlled way to manage the courses associated with a person while ensuring that the internal state of the `Person` object remains consistent and encapsulated.",

Encapsulation is one of the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) that involves bundling the data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class. It also restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which can prevent accidental interference and misuse.\n\nIn your example, the `theField` variable is currently public, which means it can be accessed directly from outside the class. To encapsulate this variable, we will make it private (i.e., accessible only within the class itself) and provide a getter method to access its value safely.\n\nHere's how you can encapsulate the `theField` variable and name its getter `getTheField`:\n\n```java\npublic class A {\n    // Private field to be encapsulated\n    private boolean[][] theField;\n\n    // Getter method to access the private field\n    public boolean[][] getTheField() {\n        return this.theField;\n    }\n\n    // Setter method (if needed) to modify the private field\n    public void setTheField(boolean[][] newField) {\n        this.theField = newField;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Private Access Modifier**: The `theField` variable is declared as `private`, which means it cannot be accessed directly from outside the class.\n2. **Getter Method**: A public method named `getTheField` is provided to safely access the value of the private field. This method returns a copy of the `theField` array (or you can modify it to return the reference if needed).\n3. **Setter Method** (Optional): If you need to allow external code to change the value of the `theField`, you can also provide a public setter method named `setTheField`. This method allows setting a new value for the private field.\n\nThis encapsulation ensures that the internal state of the class is protected from direct access and modification, promoting better control over how the data is handled.",

Additionally, I added a `setName` method to allow modifying the customer's name if needed.\n\nYou can use this class like this:\n\n```java\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Customer unknownCustomer = new Customer(\"unknown\");\n        Doxing doxingCustomer = new Doxing(unknownCustomer);\n\n        System.out.println(doxingCustomer.getDisplayName()); // Output: occupant\n\n        unknownCustomer.setName(\"John Doe\");\n        System.out.println(doxingCustomer.getDisplayName()); // Output: John Doe\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis demonstrates how the `Doxing` class encapsulates the logic for handling special cases when dealing with customer names.",

This approach adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle by encapsulating behavior related to different types of birds within their respective classes.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n1. Create an abstract base class or interface named `Bird`.\n2. Define subclasses for each type of bird (e.g., `EuropeanSwallow`, `AfricanSwallow`, and `NorwegianBlueParrot`).\n3. Override the `getStatus` method in each subclass to return the specific status based on the bird's attributes.\n\nHere is an example implementation:\n\n```java\n// Abstract base class for all birds\nabstract class Bird {\n    protected String type;\n    protected int numberOfCoconuts = 0;\n    protected double voltage = 0;\n\n    public Bird(String type) {\n        this.type = type;\n    }\n\n    // Setter methods to allow subclasses to initialize attributes\n    public void setNumberOfCoconuts(int numberOfCoconuts) {\n        this.numberOfCoconuts = numberOfCoconuts;\n    }\n\n    public void setVoltage(double voltage) {\n        this.voltage = voltage;\n    }\n\n    // Abstract method that each subclass must implement\n    abstract String getStatus();\n}\n\n// Subclass for European Swallow\nclass EuropeanSwallow extends Bird {\n    public EuropeanSwallow() {\n        super(\"EuropeanSwallow\");\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    String getStatus() {\n        return \"average\";\n    }\n}\n\n// Subclass for African Swallow\nclass AfricanSwallow extends Bird {\n    public AfricanSwallow(int numberOfCoconuts) {\n        super(\"AfricanSwallow\");\n        setNumberOfCoconuts(numberOfCoconuts);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    String getStatus() {\n        return (numberOfCoconuts > 2) ? \"tired\" : \"average\";\n    }\n}\n\n// Subclass for Norwegian Blue Parrot\nclass NorwegianBlueParrot extends Bird {\n    public NorwegianBlueParrot(double voltage) {\n        super(\"NorwegianBlueParrot\");\n        setVoltage(voltage);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    String getStatus() {\n        return (voltage > 100) ? \"scorched\" : \"beautiful\";\n    }\n}\n\n// Usage example\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Bird europeanSwallow = new EuropeanSwallow();\n        Bird africanSwallow = new AfricanSwallow(3);\n        Bird norwegianBlueParrot = new NorwegianBlueParrot(150);\n\n        System.out.println(europeanSwallow.getStatus()); // Output: average\n        System.out.println(africanSwallow.getStatus());  // Output: tired\n        System.out.println(norwegianBlueParrot.getStatus()); // Output: scorched\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this implementation, each bird type has its own subclass with a specific implementation of the `getStatus` method.

The `push`, `pop`, and `isEmpty` methods in `Stack` use the corresponding methods of the `List` delegate to perform their operations. This approach allows you to encapsulate the list behavior within a delegate object, promoting better separation of concerns and potentially easier testing and maintenance.",

        "content": " It looks like you're trying to parse an order string and calculate the total price based on a provided price list. However, there are a few issues in your code that need to be addressed:\n\n1. The `productDetails` array might not have enough elements if the input string format is incorrect.\n2. The `priceList` should be a map or some other data structure that can quickly look up prices by product name.\n3. You might want to add error handling for cases where the price list does not contain a product.\n\nHere's a more robust version of your code:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.HashMap;\nimport java.util.Map;\n\npublic class OrderProcessor {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        String orderString = \"ProductA–10 5\"; // Example order string: ProductName–Quantity Price\n        Map<String, Integer> priceList = new HashMap<>();\n        priceList.put(\"ProductA\", 20); // Example price list\n\n        try {\n            int totalPrice = doxing(orderString, priceList);\n            System.out.println(\"Total Price: \" + totalPrice);\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static int doxing(String orderString, Map<String, Integer> priceList) throws Exception {\n        String[] orderData = orderString.split(\"\\\\s+\");\n        if (orderData.length < 3) {\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Invalid order string format\");\n        }\n\n        String[] productDetails = orderData[0].split(\"–\");\n        if (productDetails.length != 2) {\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Invalid product details format\");\n        }\n\n        int quantity = Integer.parseInt(orderData[1]);\n        int productPrice = priceList.getOrDefault(productDetails[1], -1);\n        if (productPrice == -1) {\n            throw new Exception(\"Product not found in price list: \" + productDetails[1]);\n        }\n\n        return quantity * productPrice;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Input Validation**: The `doxing` method checks if the order string and product details are in the expected format.\n2. **Error Handling**: If the input string or product details are invalid, it throws an `IllegalArgumentException`.\n3. **Price List Lookup**: It uses `priceList.getOrDefault` to safely look up the price for a product. If the product is not found, it throws an exception.\n4. **Total Price Calculation**: It calculates the total price by multiplying the quantity and the product price.\n\nThis approach ensures that your code is more robust and can handle various edge cases gracefully.",
