Each bird class will override a method to return its status based on its specific attributes.\n\nHere's how you could refactor your code:\n\n1. Define an interface `Bird` with a method `getStatus()`.\n2. Implement this interface in different classes for each type of bird (`EuropeanSwallow`, `AfricanSwallow`, etc.).\n3. Each implementation will have its own logic to determine the status.\n\nHere's a sample implementation:\n\n```java\n// Define the Bird interface\npublic interface Bird {\n    String getStatus();\n}\n\n// Implement EuropeanSwallow class\npublic class EuropeanSwallow implements Bird {\n    @Override\n    public String getStatus() {\n        return \"average\";\n    }\n}\n\n// Implement AfricanSwallow class\npublic class AfricanSwallow implements Bird {\n    private int numberOfCoconuts;\n\n    public AfricanSwallow(int numberOfCoconuts) {\n        this.numberOfCoconuts = numberOfCoconuts;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String getStatus() {\n        return (numberOfCoconuts > 2) ? \"tired\" : \"average\";\n    }\n}\n\n// Implement NorwegianBlueParrot class\npublic class NorwegianBlueParrot implements Bird {\n    private int voltage;\n\n    public NorwegianBlueParrot(int voltage) {\n        this.voltage = voltage;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String getStatus() {\n        return (voltage > 100) ? \"scorched\" : \"beautiful\";\n    }\n}\n\n// Usage example\npublic class BirdManager {\n    private List<Bird> birds;\n\n    public BirdManager(List<Bird> birds) {\n        this.birds = birds;\n    }\n\n    public void displayStatuses() {\n        for (Bird bird : birds) {\n            System.out.println(bird.getStatus());\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this refactored code, the logic to determine the status of each bird is encapsulated within its respective class, making the code more maintainable and easier to extend. The `getStatus()` method in each bird class handles its specific conditionals, adhering to the principle of polymorphism.",

The methods of the `Stack` class can then be implemented in terms of the delegate's methods. This approach allows for better separation of concerns and makes it easier to replace or modify the underlying implementation of the stack without changing its interface.",

        "content": "To create a method that queries the price and name of a product, you can encapsulate the logic into a separate function. This function will take a product ID as input and return the corresponding product's details (price and name).

You can implement this method using various data storage mechanisms like a database, an in-memory map, etc.\n\n2. **processOrder Method**: This method processes the order string by splitting it into components. It then extracts the product ID and uses the `getProductDetails` method to fetch the product's details. Based on these details, it calculates the total price for the order and prints out relevant information.\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Encapsulation**: The logic for fetching product details is encapsulated in a separate method (`getProductDetails`). This makes your code more modular and easier to manage.\n- **Error Handling**: The example includes basic error handling where it checks if the product is found. In a real-world scenario, you might want to handle cases like invalid or non-existent products more gracefully.\n\nThis implementation provides a clean separation of concerns and improves the readability and maintainability of your code.",
