This class will extend the `Customer` class and override the `getName()` method to return \"occupant\" if the original name is \"unknown\". Here's how you can implement this:\n\n```java\npublic class Customer {\n    private String name;\n\n    public Customer(String name) {\n        this.name = name;\n    }\n\n    public String getName() {\n        if (\"unknown\".equals(name)) {\n            return \"occupant\";\n        }\n        return name;\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Deceiver extends Customer {\n    public Deceiver(String name) {\n        super(name);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String getName() {\n        // Call the superclass's getName method to handle other cases\n        String originalName = super.getName();\n        \n        // Return \"occupant\" if the original name is \"unknown\"\n        return \"unknown\".equals(originalName) ? \"occupant\" : originalName;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this implementation, the `Deceiver` class extends the `Customer` class and overrides the `getName()` method. The `getName()` method first calls the superclass's `getName()` method to handle any other cases. Then, it checks if the returned name is \"unknown\" and returns \"occupant\" instead.\n\nYou can now use the `Deceiver` class to create instances of customers where the special case handling for \"unknown\" names is applied:\n\n```java\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Customer customer1 = new Customer(\"John\");\n        System.out.println(customer1.getName()); // Output: John\n\n        Customer customer2 = new Deceiver(\"unknown\");\n        System.out.println(customer2.getName()); // Output: occupant\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, `customer1` is a regular `Customer` instance with the name \"John\", and `customer2` is an instance of the `Deceiver` class with the name \"unknown\". The `getName()` method for both instances correctly handles the special case.",

The `Manager` and `Developer` classes are subclasses of `Employee`, each providing its own implementation of `doWork()`.\n\nThe factory method `createEmployee` creates instances of specific employee types based on the `type` parameter, which is now replaced with subclasses rather than type codes.
