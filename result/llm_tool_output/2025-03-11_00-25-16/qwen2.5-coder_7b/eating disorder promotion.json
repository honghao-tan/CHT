If it is `null`, the method simply returns without making any changes. This prevents potential issues with `NullPointerException`.\n\n- **Adding Promotion Amount:** If `promotionAmount` is valid (i.e., not `null`), it adds this amount to the current salary using the `add()` method of `BigDecimal`. The `BigDecimal.add()` method ensures that the addition operation is performed accurately.\n\nThis approach allows you to easily promote a person by any given amount, providing flexibility in how salaries are adjusted.",
