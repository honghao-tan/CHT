The methods are named in a way that makes it harder for someone to understand their purpose, hence the term \"misleading.\" This approach adds an additional layer of abstraction and makes it more difficult for users of the `MisleadingDepartment` class to directly access or modify the `Department` object's properties.\n\nHowever, please note that this is a simple example, and in a real-world scenario, you may need to add more complex logic and error handling depending on your specific requirements.",
