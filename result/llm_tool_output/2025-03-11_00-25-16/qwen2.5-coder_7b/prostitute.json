Create subclasses for each type of bird (`EuropeanSwallow`, `AfricanSwallow`, `NorwegianBlueParrot`) and implement the `getStatus()` method in each subclass.\n\nHere's the refactored code:\n\n```java\n// Define the Bird interface\npublic interface Bird {\n    String getStatus();\n}\n\n// Implement the EuropeanSwallow class\npublic class EuropeanSwallow implements Bird {\n    @Override\n    public String getStatus() {\n        return \"average\";\n    }\n}\n\n// Implement the AfricanSwallow class\npublic class AfricanSwallow implements Bird {\n    private int numberOfCoconuts;\n\n    public AfricanSwallow(int numberOfCoconuts) {\n        this.numberOfCoconuts = numberOfCoconuts;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String getStatus() {\n        return (numberOfCoconuts > 2) ? \"tired\" : \"average\";\n    }\n}\n\n// Implement the NorwegianBlueParrot class\npublic class NorwegianBlueParrot implements Bird {\n    private int voltage;\n\n    public NorwegianBlueParrot(int voltage) {\n        this.voltage = voltage;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String getStatus() {\n        return (voltage > 100) ? \"scorched\" : \"beautiful\";\n    }\n}\n\n// Example usage\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Bird europeanSwallow = new EuropeanSwallow();\n        Bird africanSwallow = new AfricanSwallow(3);\n        Bird norwegianBlueParrot = new NorwegianBlueParrot(120);\n\n        System.out.println(europeanSwallow.getStatus()); // Output: average\n        System.out.println(africanSwallow.getStatus()); // Output: tired\n        System.out.println(norwegianBlueParrot.getStatus()); // Output: scorched\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this refactored code, the `getStatus()` method is no longer conditional. Instead, each subclass handles its specific behavior for determining the status. This approach adheres to the principle of polymorphism, allowing for easy extension and maintenance of the code.",
