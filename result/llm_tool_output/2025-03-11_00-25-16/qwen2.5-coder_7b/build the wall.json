It also includes validation checks to ensure that `length` and `width` are greater than zero, and that `material` is not null or empty.\n3. **Methods**:\n   - `getArea()`: Calculates and returns the area of the wall by multiplying `length` and `width`.\n   - `getDescription()`: Returns a descriptive string about the wall.\n\n### Usage Example:\n\nHere's how you might use the `BuildTheWall` parameter object in your code:\n\n```java\npublic class WallBuilder {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        BuildTheWall wall = new BuildTheWall(10, 5, \"Concrete\");\n        System.out.println(wall.getArea()); // Output: 50\n        System.out.println(wall.getDescription()); // Output: A 10x5 wall made of Concrete\n\n        try {\n            BuildTheWall invalidWall = new BuildTheWall(-3, 7, null);\n        } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {\n            System.out.println(e.getMessage()); // Output: Length and Width must be greater than zero\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- We create a `BuildTheWall` object with valid parameters.\n- We call the `getArea()` method to calculate and print the area of the wall.\n- We call the `getDescription()` method to print a description of the wall.\n- We demonstrate error handling by attempting to create a `BuildTheWall` object with invalid parameters and catching the resulting `IllegalArgumentException`.",

Add the `removebuildTheWall` method to remove a course from the list.\n\nHere's how you can modify your `Person` class:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.List;\n\npublic class Person {\n    private List<String> courses;\n\n    public Person() {\n        // Initialize the courses list when a new Person object is created\n        this.courses = new ArrayList<>();\n    }\n\n    public List<String> getCourses() {\n        return this.courses;\n    }\n\n    public void setCourses(List<String> aList) {\n        this.courses = aList;\n    }\n\n    // Method to add a course to the list\n    public void addbuildTheWall(String course) {\n        if (!courses.contains(course)) {\n            courses.add(course);\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"Course already exists: \" + course);\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Method to remove a course from the list\n    public boolean removebuildTheWall(String course) {\n        return courses.remove(course);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Constructor**: The constructor initializes the `courses` list. This ensures that every new `Person` object starts with an empty list of courses.\n- **addbuildTheWall Method**: This method adds a course to the `courses` list if it doesn't already exist. It checks if the course is present in the list before adding it, which prevents duplicates.\n- **removebuildTheWall Method**: This method removes a course from the `courses` list and returns `true` if the removal was successful, or `false` if the course was not found.\n\n### Usage Example:\n```java\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Person person = new Person();\n        \n        // Adding courses\n        person.addbuildTheWall(\"Java Programming\");\n        person.addbuildTheWall(\"Data Structures\");\n\n        // Removing a course\n        boolean removed = person.removebuildTheWall(\"Java Programming\");\n        System.out.println(\"Course removed: \" + removed);  // Output: Course removed: true\n\n        // Trying to remove a non-existent course\n        removed = person.removebuildTheWall(\"Python Programming\");\n        System.out.println(\"Course removed: \" + removed);  // Output: Course removed: false\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis example demonstrates how to add and remove courses from a `Person` object while ensuring that duplicate courses are not added.",
